"note_en": "It has not been a good year for customers of Petnet&#39;s cloud-connected, automated pet-feeder system. After a rough spring, with multiple prolonged service outages, the company tried a last-ditch plea to its customers: Pay a subscription fee of $4 a month, or $30 a year, and we&#39;ll be able to keep the lights on. Some users paid up\u2014but it was apparently in vain, as their smartfeeders are still basically paperweights without connected service.\n Petnet&#39;s public troubles began in February, when a service outage  took feeders offline. The connection issues lasted for more than a week, during which time Petnet was completely and utterly unresponsive to customer complaints made by email, phone, or Twitter. Nor were customers the only ones who couldn&#39;t reach the company: messages Ars and other outlets sent to Petnet&#39;s press contact bounced back with an error saying the email address did not exist.\n Service was finally restored\u2014but only fleetingly, it turned out. Customers again began to complain of system outages beginning in late March. That time, Petnet  blamed the COVID-19 crisis for its lack of response, saying in a March 26 email, &#34;One of our third party vendors has notified us that due to COVID-19 their operations are experiencing an adverse effect. We will monitor this situation closely and provide you with any updates as they arise.&#34;\n By late April, it seemed the company was simply done for. As of April 27, the last time we wrote about Petnet, the service outage had lasted for weeks and the company was once again completely unresponsive. The last time the public had heard from Petnet was on April 14, when the company posted a tweet  describing a continued systems outage. Then, on April 24, Petnet sent an email to all customers saying, &#34;The Petnet community needs your help.&#34; The company was on the brink of collapse, the email explained: Due to the COVID-19 crisis, all remaining funding dried up. The company said it &#34;reorganized its resources&#34; in response\u2014a reorganization that included furloughing 100 percent of the staff and ceasing all future product development.\n  That email also included a link to a  survey, asking customers how they would feel about continuing to receive service in exchange for a subscription fee. &#34;This model would fund the monthly operating cost to run the Petnet infrastructure and customer support,&#34; the message explained. &#34;This model would be billed at a monthly rate of $4 /month or $30 annually, which would be a 37.5% discount.&#34;\n Petnet seemed to rally after that. On May 29, it sent an email to customers that service was restored:\n We are delighted to announce that our systems are back online for your first generation SmartFeeder. Hopefully, you have already noticed that functionality has returned. As we detailed to you previously, customers overwhelmingly favored a subscription model to keep your SmartFeeder online. So, we are moving forward with that model, and details about what to expect can be found below.\n Petnet has always put the needs of our customers\u2019 pets first, and we appreciate your support in helping us do that with this new model. Based on your response to our subscription survey, you have selected the option to pay a yearly subscription price of $30.\n Your $30 per year subscription provides us with the ability to maintain our systems infrastructure and continue offering the customer support you deserve... Petnet services will be exclusively available to subscription users after June 30.\n Petnet&#39;s Twitter account also apparently  rose from the dead on June 10 to announce that the service disruption was resolved.\n Some users took Petnet up on the new offer, hoping to continue using their feeders as normal. But money apparently did not solve Petnet&#39;s woes, and service has not improved since the subscription model was activated.\n  &#34;I just paid $30 through PayPal for an annual subscription but am now questioning whether this is actually legitimate,&#34; one user wrote to Ars in late June, adding that she was still unable to access the app on her phone. She contacted Petnet again several times trying to have her app password reset, but as of July 1, she concluded, &#34;Looks like I have been scammed... the support email address no longer exists.&#34;\n Another Ars reader reached out last week saying that he had paid $30 for a year of service, but as of July 2, although his feeder still functioned and fed his cat every day, &#34;I cannot connect to the device or control it using the app,&#34; which could not connect even though Petnet said it would be available after June 30. &#34;Several times over the last two days I have tried to contact them via phone, email, and Facebook with no luck,&#34; he added.\n Several users on Twitter also approached the @petnetiosupport account with similar complaints. &#34;I still can&#39;t even set up an account,&#34;  one wrote.

According to Crunchbase data, Palantir has raised billions while private, making its debut a marquee affair in the worlds of technology, startups and venture capital.\n As  TechCrunch reported yesterday, Palantir has a controversial product history,  including helping locate immigrants for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency,  connecting databases for intelligence agencies and  recently winning no-bid contracts to gather data about the COVID-19 pandemic for the White House Pandemic Task Force.\n  The Exchange is a daily look at startups and the private markets for Extra Crunch subscribers; use code EXCHANGE to get full access and  take 25% off your subscription.\n  The company\u2019s filing comes after a long incubation period; it\u2019s been 17 years since Palantir\u2019s founding in 2003. Since then, its reported financial performance and fundraising history have become sufficiently convoluted that I couldn\u2019t tell you this morning how big the company really is or how much it raised before its most recent investment.\n To prep us for its eventual  public IPO filing, let\u2019s go back in time and collect data points from Palantir\u2019s reported history. This way when we do get the company\u2019s S-1 filing, we\u2019ll better understand what we\u2019re looking at.\n  Even with companies that aren\u2019t privacy-conscious, it can be hard to craft a comprehensive history of their business activities from when they were private. With Palantir, it\u2019s even trickier.\n Still, leaning on more than a decade of TechCrunch reporting, Crunchbase data, other publications and  Craft.co, what follows is a reasonable look at what has been reported about Palantir through time.

Microsoft&#39;s M&amp;A strategy and venture fund as executive vice president of business development.\n Microsoft executive Peggy Johnson will join Magic Leap as CEO in August, the start-up\u00a0 announced Tuesday.\n Johnson joins the augmented reality start-up after leading Microsoft&#39;s M&amp;A strategy and launching its venture fund as executive vice president of business development. She was hired by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in 2014 after a 24-year career at Qualcomm, where she worked in several roles, including running the internet services unit. At Microsoft, Johnson has served as a member of the company&#39;s senior leadership team and navigated Microsoft through major partnership deals and acquisitions, including its $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn in 2016.\n  Magic Leap&#39;s announcement comes after its founder and CEO Rony Abovitz  announced in May he would step down from the role, saying in a statement that with changes at the company, &#34;it became clear to us that a change in my role was a natural next step.&#34;\n Founded in 2011, Magic Leap was the subject of extensive hype in its early days, and managed to raise about  $3 billion\u00a0from Alphabet&#39;s\u00a0 Google and other investors. But the company&#39;s  first product, released in 2018 for over $2,000, showed lowered ambitions since the company&#39;s early demonstrations and did not sell well, and Magic Leap recently pivoted to focus on business scenarios. During the coronavirus pandemic, Magic Leap  announced in April it would lay off staff as part of a structure overhaul.  The New York Times reported that about 600 of its 1,900 workers were impacted.\n Johnson told the  New York Times that she was driven to take the job because she wanted to be a chief executive. Her last day at Microsoft will be July 7, the company said in a  filing.\n Microsoft will look at internal and external candidates to replace Johnson, a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC, and in the meantime, finance chief Amy Hood will take on her direct reports.\n In an email to Microsoft executives Tuesday morning, Nadella wrote, &#34;I want to thank Peggy for her leadership and partnership these past six years. Her ability to connect people, drive consensus, and forge relationships has taught me a lot. Through the years, she has been a clear role model for women at Microsoft and in technology, and I know she&#39;ll continue to inspire young women in STEM in her new role.&#34;", "posttime":

"note_en": "(CNN) \u2014  A  glacier in Italy is turning pink because of algae -- a development that will make the  ice melt faster, a scientist studying the phenomenon says.\n Pink snow has appeared at the Presena glacier in northern Italy, researcher Biagio Di Mauro, of the Institute of Polar Sciences at Italy&#39;s National Research Council, told CNN Monday.\n  While &#34;watermelon snow,&#34; as it is sometimes known, is fairly common in the Alps in spring and summer, it has been more marked this year.\n  When Di Mauro went to the glacier on Saturday to investigate, &#34;there was quite an impressive bloom of snow algae,&#34; he said.\n He told CNN he believes an alga named Chlamydomonas nivalis is responsible for the change in color.\n This spring and summer have seen low snowfall and high atmospheric temperatures, Di Mauro said, adding: &#34;This creates the perfect environment for the algae to grow.&#34;\n  Algal blooms are bad news for the health of the glacier as darker snow absorbs more energy, meaning it melts faster.\n  The phenomenon has been particularly common this year, said Di Mauro, who plans to study it in more detail to work out the concentration of the algae and map the blooms using satellite data.\n  Di Mauro has previously studied the Morteratsch glacier in Switzerland, where an alga called Ancylonema nordenskioeldii has turned the ice purple.\n This alga has also been found in southwestern Greenland as well in as the Andes and Himalayas.\n   In October 2019, research revealed glaciers in Switzerland have shrunk 10% in the past five years, a rate that has never been seen before in more than a century of observations.\n  In Antarctica, the giant Denman Glacier has retreated almost three miles in the past 22 years, according to research published in March.", "posttime": "2020-07-07 22:45:30", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u85fb\u7c7b,glacier", "title":

The software first asks a series of questions about lifestyle, location, etc. For example, Nayya founder and CEO Sina Chehrazi explained that people who bike to work, as opposed to driving in a car, walking or taking public transportation, are 20 times more likely to get into an accident and need emergency services.\n Companion asks questions in this vein, as well as questions around whether you take medication regularly or if you expect your healthcare costs to go up or down over the next year, without getting into the specifics of chronic ailments or diseases or particular issues.\n Taking that data into account, Nayya then looks at the various plans provided by the employer to show you which one matches the user\u2019s particular lifestyle and budget best.\n Nayya doesn\u2019t just pull information directly from the insurance company directory listings, as nearly 40 percent of those listings have at least one error or are out of date. It pulls from a broad variety of data sources, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to get the cleanest, most precise data around which doctors are in network and the usual costs associated with visiting those doctors.\n  Alongside Companion, Nayya also provides a product called \u2018Edison,\u2019 which it has dubbed the Alexa for Helathcare. Users can ask Edison questions like \u201cWhat is my deductible?\u201d or \u201cIs Dr. So-and-So in my network and what would it cost to go see her?\u201d\n The company helps individual users find the right provider for them with the ability to compare costs, location, and other factors involved. Nayya even puts a badge on listings for providers where another employee at the company has gone and had a great experience, giving another layer of validation to that choice.\n As the healthtech industry looks to provide easier-to-use healthcare and insurance, the idea of \u2018personalization\u2019 has been left behind in many respects. Nayya focuses first and foremost on the end-user and aims to ensure that their own personal healthcare journey is as simple and straightforward as possible, believing that the other pieces of the puzzle will fall into place when the customer is taken care of.\n Nayya plans on using the funding to expand the team across engineering, data science, product management and marketing, as well as doubling down on the amount of data the company is purchasing, ingesting and cleaning.\n Alongside charging employers on a per seat, per month basis, Nayya is also looking to start going straight to insurance companies with its product.\n \u201cThe greatest challenge is educating an entire ecosystem and convincing that ecosystem to believe that where the consumer wins, everyone wins,\u201d said Chehrazi. \u201cHow to finance and understand your healthcare has never been more important than it is right now, and there is a huge need to provide that education in a data driven way to people. That\u2019s where I want to spend the next I don\u2019t know how many years of my life to drive that change.\u201d\n Nayya has five full-time employees currently and 80 percent of the team comes from

"note_en": "Previously we took a look at  Snapchat\u2019s root detection methods on Android. This time we are taking a look at how they detect jailbreaks, tweaks and hooks on iOS.\n   This is the message you see when you try to login with a detected tweak, although not all tweaks trigger this message. Two examples that trigger this message are  Flex 3 and  Wraith. Some just flag your account and will get you banned later in a ban wave if you are unlucky.\n  So obviously the first thing we want to look at is, what has the community tried so far to stay hidden? If you google around a bit you will most likely end up with these result. For a few of them, I will list the most notable features.\n NoSub (or variants)  Only if you can find an updated version and don\u2019t want to use tweaks on Snapchat.\n   But it seems that nobody knows what Snapchat is  exactly doing to detect everything. Which is why I am writing this post. Only one that I have seen  publicly making efforts to figure this out is the developer of Phantom, CokePokes.\n   When you launch the app they create a new thread using  pthread_create that runs all the checks. At the end of these checks an integer is stored with flags of everything that was detected on the device. Some of these checks are then ran every 31 seconds.\n All the code executed for these checks is obfuscated with  Snapchats in-house obfuscation tools and thus very annoying to look at using tools such as IDA.\n  One of the first things they do is checking and storing stuff from the code signature. This happens using the  sys_csops(169) syscall, which is pretty much undocumented but is very similar to the code here.\n    The most important one of this is the  CS_OPS_STATUS, this retrieves the current codesigning status of the process. A jailbroken device can respond with messy status flags. Such as:\n     The result of  CS_OPS_STATUS and  CS_OPS_CDHASH are stored and later sent to the Snapchat servers, encrypted.\n  This is a simple check but quite effective if not noticed by a tweak developer. Pseudo code looks like this.\n     One way is using  dyld_get_image_header and  dladdr. They iterate over  dyld_get_image_header until it returns null and checks if it has seen everything with  dyld_image_count. The  dladdr method provides them with the path of the dylib. These are checked against a few unknown strings but removing everything substrate related from the dyld list fixes this check.\n  The other method they use is calling  task_info with flavor  TASK_DYLD_INFO. This also gives them a list of all loaded dylibs and must be fixed separately from the first dyld check.\n  There are a couple of file system checks, of which all use the  sys_access(33) syscall.\n       The last one makes it a bit harder to fix, since you can not simply replace the arm instructions with something that makes it always return false. Thus requiring an inline hook as replacement for the syscall so you gain full control over it.\n  A lot of classes are checked from a lot of different tweaks. This is done using  objc_getClass.\n   They also check methods. This happens using  objc_getClass and then  class_getInstanceMethod. If any exists, you get flagged.\n   Next up is Snapchats own methods. For the classes listed below they first call  class_copyMethodList. Then for every  Method they check if the  IMP pointer (address of the function) is within its own  __text segment. This is how they detect whether a method has been hooked.\n    They also check for a couple of symbols using  dlsym. If the result is not null, you get flagged.\n   A few symbols are resolved using  dlsym to check whether they have been hooked. They first resolve  dlsym using  dlsym.. yeah.. That result gets used for the  dlsym of the symbols below. For every address returned, the first 4 bytes are checked for common hook related instructions.\n   I need to be honest, this is a very annoying way how they check for injection because it is annoying to fix. Instead of using  getenv they use the  environ variable. Since it is a variable, you can not \u201chook\u201d it.\n       Not much detection done here but still relevant, using  sys_sysctl(202) they request at least the following properties.\n   The syscall  sys_proc_info(33) is also called a couple of times, which could reveal stuff that is ptracing the process. They also use  sys_open(5),  mmap,  sys_close(6) and  sys_lstat64(340) on the  Snapchat binary. Probably to check for modifications or generating a checksum.\n  A lot of the work was done using a small iOS emulator build on top of  Unicorn. Using an emulator you can see everything they do. Building this was also teached me a lot about the CoreFoundation library of iOS.\n  Later I implemented a counter for all of my discoveries in a tweak called  SnapHide while carefully keeping track of how my changes modified the detection flags and slowly getting rid of all of them. You can easily find fixes for checks mentioned in this blog post in the \u201cDetections\u201d directory.\n You could alternatively trace the syscalls using any of the methods discussed in the WhoYouGonnaSyscall talk by  Hexploitable. Slides of the talk can be found  here.\n  Let\u2019s take  sys_access(33) as an example. It\u2019s implementation looks like  this. In short, when a file exists and permission is granted, return  0. Otherwise return  -1. First thing I did was force both of the results in my emulator but I saw no changes happening to the detection flags.\n Later when implementing a fix for this in the  SnapHide tweak, I was unable to have it fail. The arm instructions look like this:\n MOV X0, X27 ; pathMOV X1, #0 ; modeMOV X16, #0x21SVC 0x80 ; SYS_accessMOV X0, #0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFCSEL X0, X0, XZR, CSMOV X27, X0 ; Use result\n  v23 = mac_syscall(SYS_access, a20, 0);v24 = -1;if ( !v20 ) v24 = 0;*(v21 + 496) = v24;\n Coming from android I was very confused what happened here. Looking at the instructions, they seem to directly clear the result from the syscall. Looking at the pseudo code reveals a bit more information. Apparently what happens is, \u201cA syscall return errno an sets the carry flag on error\u201d from  here. Setting and clearing the carry flag resulted in detection changes. This took me a few hours to figure out for some reason. Later I found out that I could simply remove the MOV &amp; CSEL instruction. Which gave me 8 bytes more space for patching.\n   Awesome! That\u2019s a good thing. However, keep in mind that some of the checks above are not countered by UnSub at this moment. Everything that has  syscall mentioned for example is not countered and you will not be able to sign in if you have  Flex 3 installed. UnSub does  not prevent Cydia Substrate from loading, it  attempts to hide it. Which also fails because Snapchat does not even use this call.\n   This was a very fun but also very annoying 2 weeks with a lot of headaches. I hope this brings some light into why some stuff gets people banned. If there are any issue\u2019s with with tweak feel free to submit an issue on GitHub.

Struggling to survive amid a cash crunch and facing bankruptcy, the company laid off most of its staff in April and was casting around for a white knight investor to come in and keep the company afloat. While the Paradise, Fla.-based company found the $375 million in funding it needed,  according to The New York Times, that investment  came at the price of Rony Abovitz\u2019s position as chief executive.\n  Abovitz, whose vision for the future of spatial computing managed to rake in over a billion dollars in funding, was a consummate hype man whose products failed to deliver on the promise they\u2019d held.\n  In Johnson Magic Leap has a proven executive who joined Microsoft in 2014 from  Qualcomm   as an executive hire made by chief executive Satya Nadella. There, she ran business development and had a hand in a number of the company\u2019s major acquisitions and partnerships including the $26.2 billion blockbuster acquisition of  LinkedIn  . The 58 year-old Johnson also launched Microsoft\u2019s venture capital fund (known as M12).\n At Magic Leap, Johnson will take the reins of a company whose direction has shifted to focus more on businesses than on consumers \u2014 a strategy that mirrors approaches taken both by Microsoft\u2019s Hololens extended reality product and by early wearable tech progenitor Google Glass.\n It\u2019s also a company that managed to burn through nearly $3.5 billion under Abovitz\u2019s stewardship and lose a valuation of\n \u201cSince its founding in 2011, Magic Leap has pioneered the field of spatial computing, and I have long admired the relentless efforts and accomplishments of this exceptional team. Magic Leap\u2019s technological foundation is undeniable, and there is no question that has the potential to shape the future of XR and computing,\u201d said Ms. Johnson.\n Before joining Microsoft, Ms. Johnson spent 24 years at Qualcomm, where she held various leadership positions, and served as a member of Qualcomm\u2019s Executive Committee.\n \u201cAs a company that has been a leader in transforming what will become the next era of computing, we have been fortunate to have a number of extremely qualified candidates express interest in the position of CEO. However, as soon as Peggy raised her hand there was no question in my mind, or the Board\u2019s, that she was absolutely the best person to lead this company into the future,\u201d said Abovitz in a statement. \u201cAs Magic Leap drives towards commercializing spatial computing for enterprise, I can\u2019t think of a better and more capable leader than  Peggy Johnson\u00a0to carry our mission

"note_en": "Though the company in May had also announced plans for a newly designed Instagram Shop with a different layout than what\u2019s available today through Explore, those changes aren\u2019t being tested at present. Instead, this new global test will direct users to the same \u201cShop\u201d experience that U.S users been able to reach by tapping the \u201cShop\u201d button in Explore.\n The main difference is that the Shop icon will replace the heart icon (Activity) in Instagram\u2019s main navigation.\n    Thankfully, the Activity section isn\u2019t totally gone. For those in the test, the Activity tab can either be accessed at the top right of your Feed (next to the paper airline Direct icon) or by going to your profile and clicking the heart icon from there.\n In this version of Instagram Shop accessed from the main navigation bar, users can filter by brands they follow or by category, including things like Beauty, Clothing &amp; Accessories, Home, Jewelry &amp; Watches, and Travel, for example. In addition, not all products showcased in this version of Shop allow users to check out directly from Instagram\u2019s universal cart. Instead, some brands have items tagged for shopping, but direct users to their own website to complete the transaction.\n If the business is testing Instagram\u2019s own Checkout feature, however, a small selling  fee is involved.\n An upcoming Instagram Shop experience will look a little different. Instagram had said in May it will feature collections from  @shop, alongside selections from the user\u2019s favorite brands and creators. These shopping options are laid out on the screen in a more intentional manner, with bigger images at the top of the screen, following by a scrollable row of brands, and then personalized content below in a \u201cSuggested For You\u201d section.\n This new experience is still expected to arrive later this year, but an exact date has yet to be determined.\n Instagram had already been testing today\u2019s change with some portion of its U.S. user base. The expanded test will now introduce the change to a small number of users worldwide, including the U.S.\n Instagram says it will use the results of this test to determine how it will roll out Shop further down the road. It\u2019s possible the company could revisit the idea of replacing Activity with Shop if it didn\u2019t increase Shop traffic and conversions.\n \u201cThis is a small global test of the Instagram Shop tab that we announced in May. We\u2019ll use this test to assess how we decide to roll this out further,\u201d a company spokesperson said.\n This is not the first time Instagram has downgraded the Activity tab. Last year, it  removed the feature that let users see which posts their friends and coworkers were liking.", "posttime": "2020-07-07 21:19:54", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name":

"note_en": "The startup originally positioned itself as the  \u2018NCAA of esports\u2019 but, after some time in stealth, has taken a new approach. Athlane is looking to be the connective fiber between streamers and brands, facilitating sponsorship and endorsement deals with more transparent data and analytics and a streamlined communications flow.\n   Brands can use the Athlane Terminal to manage their sponsorships. The Insights Hub uses proprietary data to help brands understand which streamers are followed by their target demographic, and whether or not the products will resonate with that fanbase. Insights also allow brands to see when a streamer\u2019s viewership is growing.\n From there, brands can send out sponsorship deals to streamers directly through the Athlane Terminal, and then track the ROI on that sponsorship deal throughout the campaign.\n On the streamer side, the company has built out a platform called Athlane Pro, which lets streamers manage each task from their sponsors individually. Streamers can also use Athlane Pro to counter-offer inbound sponsorship deals or negotiate terms.\n Streamers can also use Athlane\u2019s machine learning algorithm to get clearer insights on their stream performance, such as whether their YouTube viewership overlaps with their Twitch viewership, or see which videos do better based on title or thumbnail. But more importantly, the Athlane Content Hub gives streamers the opportunity to understand if their fanbase specifically aligns with this or that brand, and gives them the tools to reach out directly to that brand and solicit a sponsorship.\n Athlane has also built out a Shop tool that lets streamers build out a no-code storefront for their fans, which they can link to on their Twitch, Twitter, Instagram, etc. This storefront can be a repository for all the products that streamer is endorsing, allowing fans to see products from multiple brands in a single place.\n \u201cWe have a number of proprietary partnerships with data providers including companies like Twitter,\u201d said cofounder Faisal Younus. \u201cFor example, we have a partnership with the leading manufacturer of apparel in eSports, which ties back into our system so we can look at how merchandise is moving.\u201d\n That data, when paired with the data provided when a streamer signs in and integrates with the platform, becomes very precise, according to the company.\n The startup charges brands using a tiered SaaS model, and streamers can do their first sponsorship for free on the platform. After the first sponsorship, streamers are charged a fee between $10 and $20 per deal. Athlane has also started working with agencies that represent brands and charges a discovery fee for talent those agencies find on the platform.\n \u201cCOVID-19 has brought on very rapid growth on the viewership side, and because of that we\u2019ve seen an intense interest from a number of brands while conventional entertainment is shut down,\u201d said Younus. \u201cA lot of media spend is going to go unspent, but there is also a higher risk appetite for spending a little bit in esports, and our challenge is making sure this industry growth is sustained.\u201d\n He added that helping brands understand the true ROI of that spend will be key.", "posttime": "2020-07-07 21:19:28", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "sports,\u4f53\u80b2,\u8d44\u91d1,connect,\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53", "title": "\nAthane\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7330\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u65b0\u8d44\u91d1\u5c06\u54c1\u724c\u548c\u4f53\u80b2\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53\u8fde\u63a5\u8d77\u6765", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tAthlane looks to connect brands and esports streamers with a fresh $3.3 million in funding\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/athlane-looks-to-connect-brands-and-esports-streamers-with-a-fresh-3-3-million-in-funding/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["sports", "\u4f53\u80b2", "\u8d44\u91d1", "connect", "\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "d03b08a09da65c25eb15ed7d2fcaef36.jpg", "infoid": 1010317, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u53d8\u5f97\u5f02\u5e38\u6fc0\u70c8\uff0cKoyeb\u60f3\u8981\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06Koyeb\u4e0e\u591a\u4e2a\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u8ba9Koyeb\u6765\u627f\u62c5\u7e41\u91cd\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\n\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u7531DigitalOcean\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u5b58\u50a8\u6876\u4e2d\u5b58\u50a8\u5927\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u3002\u5047\u8bbe\u60a8\u60f3\u8981\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c6\u9891\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u65b0\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u4ee5\u9488\u5bf9\u65b0\u8bbe\u5907\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002Koyeb\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u6b64\u5b58\u50a8\u6876\u4e2d\u5bfc\u5165\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u7f16\u7801\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u65b0\u6587\u4ef6\u4e0a\u4f20\u5230\u60a8\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u6876\u4e2d\u3002\n\u4f46Koyeb\u66f4\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u60a8\u6df7\u5408\u642d\u914d\u670d\u52a1\u548cAPI\u3002\u968f\u7740\u4e91\u5e73\u53f0\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u4e3a\u60a8\u8fd0\u884c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u6570\u636e\u3002\n\u4f8b\u5982\uff0cGoogle Cloud\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u5230\u6587\u672cAPI\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bf4\u6bd4\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u8f6c\u5f55\u66f4\u597d\u3002Koyeb\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u591a\u4e91\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u4eceAWS S3\u5b58\u50a8\u6876\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u89c6\u9891\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c6\u9891\u6587\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u8f6c\u5f55\u5230Google Cloud\u4e0a\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u4fdd\u5b58\u5230AWS S3\u5b58\u50a8\u6876\u4e2d\u3002\nKoyeb\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u7528\u4f8b\u3002\u5b83\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u4ece\u6bcf\u5929\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u4ece\u4e0eS3\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u5b58\u50a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a0b\u5e8f\u590d\u5236\u5230\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bf9\u8c61\u5b58\u50a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5230\u901a\u8fc7API\u8c03\u7528\u89e6\u53d1\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u3002\u4e00\u5207\u90fd\u4f1a\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4e00\u65e6\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u60a8\u5c31\u4e0d\u518d\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4ed8\u8d39\u3002\n\u5df2\u7ecf\u6709\u51e0\u5341\u79cd\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6e90(\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u8f93\u51fa)\u548c\u73b0\u6210\u7684\u5904\u7406API\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u547d\u4ee4\u884c\u754c\u9762\u6216Koyeb API\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2a\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u5728Web\u754c\u9762\u4e2d\u914d\u7f6e\u6240\u6709\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\n\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u521a\u521a\u8d70\u51fa\u4f4e\u8c03\uff0c\u5df2\u7ecf\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5c06\u6765\u60a8\u5c06\u80fd\u591f\u4f7f\u7528Docker\u5bb9\u5668\u548c\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8fd9\u5e94\u8be5\u4f1a\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002\u4f46\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f88\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u5f00\u59cb\u3002", "note_en": "Competition has become incredibly fierce between cloud service providers, and  Koyeb   wants to take advantage of that. You can integrate Koyeb with multiple cloud service providers and let  Koyeb   do the heavy lifting.\n For instance, you may store a ton of videos on an object storage bucket managed by DigitalOcean. Let\u2019s say you want to re-encode those videos to optimize them for a new device. Koyeb can import data from this bucket, re-encode those videos and upload the new files to your bucket.\n  But Koyeb goes one step-further by letting you mix and match services and APIs. As cloud platforms become smarter, they provide services that go beyond running servers and storing data for you.\n For instance, Google Cloud\u2019s  speech-to-text API is arguably better than  Amazon Transcribe. Instead of having to manually set up a multi-cloud workflow, Koyeb can take video files from an AWS S3 bucket, transcribes the audio from those video files on Google Cloud and save the result on the AWS S3 bucket.\n There are many use cases for Koyeb. It ranges from copying data from an S3-compatible object storage provider to another every day for redundancy to triggering data processing with API calls. Everything scales automatically and once a workflow is done, you no longer get billed for runtime.\n There are already dozens of  integrations with data sources (as input and output) and ready-to-use processing APIs. Everything can be configured in the web interface with multiple processing steps, using a command-line interface or the Koyeb API.\n The company is just coming out of stealth and is already working on more product updates. For instance, you\u2019ll be able to use Docker containers and custom functions in the future, which should enable a lot more workflows. But it\u2019s a promising start.", "posttime": "2020-07-07 21:19:14", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u521d\u521b,serverless,koyeb", "title":

"note_en": "The round was led by \u200bKindred Ventures, \u200bStride.VC\u200b and Amaranthine Partners with support from numerous CTO angel investors, who believe in the company\u2019s vision.\n Those CTOs like that the company is building a one-stop shop for DevOps in the cloud, says co-founder and CEO Will Stewart. \u201cNorthflank is what we call a full-stack cloud platform that allows a developer to sign up, connect their version control \u2014 GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab \u2014 and immediately build and deploy all of their repositories via a Docker file,\u201d he explained.\n  The two founders, Stewart and Frederik Brix, met in 2011 as young teens, through online multi-player gaming. Stewart was in London, while Brix grew up in Zurich. As they got older, they helped build online communities around their passion for gaming, and eventually decided to build an online DevOps platform together as they entered university because they saw first hand the issues they had running game servers in the 2015 timeframe.\n Even though they were quite young at the time, they wanted to take advantage of the nascent cloud native tooling like Kubernetes and they began to tinker with it, and the idea of building their own platform began to take shape. They continued working on the idea while attending university and didn\u2019t even meet in person until last year when they attended an accelerator together in Paris.\n That led to \u00a3250,000 in angel money and bought them time to hire some additional engineers to build out the platform and get it ready for market. Today it provides a soup-to-nuts modern developer experience in a slick interface where you can schedule jobs and projects and manage and run builds.\n They currently have a team of 9 people including the two founders. The pandemic did not change the way they worked since they have worked remotely from the start. Most of the team has never met in person. He says as an international, fully remote company, he can hire people from anywhere, and he\u2019s hopeful that will lead to a more diverse workforce as they grow and develop as a company.\n Stewart admits that making the transition from full time developer to managing a company has been challenging, but he\u2019s learning as he goes. \u201cIt\u2019s been an interesting learning process. It\u2019s almost like diving in at the deep end.

Among some of the key figures are the fact that it can be up to 3x more expensive to recycle a ton of material rather than simply dropping it off in a landfill. Outside of the positive press around sustainability and the rare instance of corporate altruism, that\u2019s a rather large fiscal penalty for doing the right thing.\n For its part, the Replenysh team says it\u2019s \u201cbuilding this new digital supply chain.\u201d What that means in less buzzwordy terms is that the company is working to provide software solutions designed to benefit both those selling recycled goods and companies looking to acquire the materials.

"note_en": "But in the time since,  AI-powered startups have matured into real companies, with  investors stepping up to fund their growth. In niches, from medical imaging, of course,  to speech recognition, machine learning and deep learning and neural nets and everything else that one might scoop into the AI bucket has seemed to have grown neatly in recent quarters.\n Indeed, AI investing has become so popular amongst VCs that this publication  wound up debating  the finer points of AI-focused startup revenue quality earlier this year.\n  But AI is not the only startup niche appearing to enjoy tailwinds lately. No-code and low-code startups  have also enjoyed  increasing media recognition, and, as TechCrunch has covered,  notable venture capital rounds.\n Sitting in the middle of the two trends, a startup called  MonkeyLearn wants to bring  low-code  AI to companies of all sizes. And the firm just raised $2.2 million. Let\u2019s take a look.\n  Starting with the round,  MonkeyLearn   has raised $2.2 million in a round led by  Uncork Capital and  Bling Capital. Speaking with  Ra\u00fal Garreta, a co-founder at the company and also its CEO, TechCrunch learned that MonkeyLearn started off as a more developer-focused service that provided machine learning tooling via an API. But after demand materialized from people who couldn\u2019t code to use the company\u2019s tech for text analysis, the company wound up heading in a slightly different direction.\n Garreta gave TechCrunch a demo of the company\u2019s service, which allows users to upload data \u2014 think rows of text in an Excel file, for example \u2014 and quickly train MonkeyLearn\u2019s software to parse out what they are looking for. After the model is trained over the course of a few minutes, it can then be set to work on a full data set.\n According to Garreta, text analysis has a lot of demand in corporate environments, from categories like support ticket sorting to sentiment analysis.\n But MonkeyLearn\u2019s product that TechCrunch saw is not the company\u2019s final vision. Today the service focuses on data analysis. In time, Garreta wants it to do more with data visualization, providing graphing and other similar outputs to give more of a dashboard-feel to its product.\n  At the core of MonkeyLearn\u2019s early market traction that helped it land its seed round is the ever-increasing need for non-developers to collect, parse, act on and share data inside of their workplace. If you\u2019ve ever worked nearby to a startup\u2019s marketing or customer success team, you understand this phenomenon. MonkeyLearn wants to give non-developer teams the tools they need to understand data sets without forcing them to go find the engineering team and argue for a spot on the roadmap.\n \u201cOur vision is to make AI approachable by providing a toolkit for teams to actually use AI in their daily operations,\u201d Garreta said in a release. MonkeyLearn is theoretically well-situated in the market. Companies are increasingly data-driven at the same time as the market is strapped for employees who can make data sing.\n The startup has a free tier, and a few paid tiers, along with add-ons and a one-off option. You can call that the \u201c all of the above\u201d pricing model, which is fine, given the youth of the company; startups are allowed to experiment.\n After slower than anticipated early fundraising, MonkeyLearn told TechCrunch that it could have raised double in its seed round what it wound up accepting.\n What plans does the company have for the new capital? A more aggressive go-to-market motion, and a more formal sales team, it said. As MonkeyLearn sells to to mid-market and enterprise firms, Garreta explained, a more formal sales team is needed, though he also emphasized that founders must start the selling process at a startup.\n As with most seed companies that raise capital, there\u2019s a lot to like with MonkeyLearn.
