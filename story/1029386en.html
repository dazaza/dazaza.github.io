In fact, if you had asked me before I actually took the leap if this was within the realm of possibility, I would have said  hell freakin’ no.</p><p>创办自己的公司从来不是我人生目标的一部分，更不用说一个人的公司了。事实上，如果你在我真正迈出这一步之前问我，这是否在可能的范围内，我会说该死的不是。</p><p> To be honest, I hadn’t thought about it even after I started working on Lunch Money. It was only after I saw success during launch that I decided to quit my freelancing jobs to pursue this endeavour full-time.</p><p>老实说，即使在我开始用午餐钱工作之后，我也没有想过这一点。直到我在发射过程中看到成功后，我才决定辞去自由撰稿人的工作，全职从事这项工作。</p><p> So why the 180-degree change? Upon reflection, I realized that the aggregate of my life and work experience made this a sensible decision and allowed me to transition easily into the role. I feel that I was ready for something like this for some time, but I had learned to be picky with what I spend my effort on and the right project never came up until Lunch Money.  In this article, I will go into 4 specific life and career decisions that I consider foundational to my solopreneurship journey.</p><p>那么，为什么会有180度的变化呢？经过深思熟虑，我意识到我的生活和工作经历的积累使我做出了一个明智的决定，并使我能够很容易地过渡到这个角色。我觉得我已经为这样的事情做好了一段时间的准备，但我已经学会了对我所花的精力挑剔，直到午餐钱才出现合适的项目。在这篇文章中，我将探讨4个具体的生活和职业决定，我认为这4个决定是我个人职业生涯之旅的基础。</p><p>  I had never given much thought to how important transferrable skills were until I realized that simply being a software engineer at any tech company in the Bay Area did not result in more-or-less the same set of experiences and skills.</p><p>我从来没有过多地考虑过可转移技能的重要性，直到我意识到，在旧金山湾区的任何一家科技公司担任软件工程师都不会带来或多或少相同的经验和技能。</p><p> A friend told me a story of how working at [unnamed large software company] simplified a lot of processes for the sake of moving quickly. For instance, databases could be spun up via one-click deploy coupled with homegrown configuration files for adjustments. They’d later on realize as they were job hunting that setting up a data store was not so straight forward, but all the difficult parts had been abstracted out and they never got the chance to peek under the hood.</p><p>一位朋友给我讲了一个故事，讲的是在(未具名的大型软件公司)工作是如何简化了很多流程，以便行动迅速。例如，可以通过一次单击部署结合自行开发的配置文件进行调整来启动数据库。后来他们在找工作的时候意识到，建立数据存储并不是那么简单，但所有困难的部分都被抽象出来了，他们从来没有机会窥视引擎盖下的情况。</p><p> Consider two internships I had during my college years. The first was at Qualcomm– a large well-known international company with decades of proven engineering expertise. The second was a small seed-funded start-up of 3 founders, another intern and myself that had recently pivoted and hadn’t found their product market fit yet.</p><p>考虑一下我在大学期间的两份实习工作。第一个是在高通(Qualcomm)，这是一家拥有数十年久经考验的工程专业知识的大型知名国际公司。第二个是一个由3名创始人、另一名实习生和我组成的小型种子投资初创公司，他们最近刚刚转型，还没有发现他们的产品市场适合他们。</p><p> Granted that Qualcomm is in a totally different field of embedded software and hardware engineering, a lot of the tech I worked with was proprietary. I learned virtually no transferrable hard skills during my double-term internship at Qualcomm.</p><p>尽管高通在嵌入式软件和硬件工程领域是一个完全不同的领域，但我与之合作的许多技术都是专有的。在高通的两个学期的实习期间，我几乎没有学到任何可转让的硬技能。</p><p> At the smaller (now defunct) start-up, I learned how to use Github. I worked with open source projects for the first time. I learned how to communicate with clients as I was building apps for them. I learned how to think about web versus mobile design. I learned a ton of Javascript. These are all skillsets I am still tapping into today.</p><p>在一家规模较小(现已倒闭)的初创公司，我学会了如何使用Github。我第一次参与开源项目。在为客户开发应用程序时，我学会了如何与客户沟通。我学会了如何思考网络设计与移动设计。我学了一大堆Javascript。这些都是我今天还在学习的技能。</p><p> The bottom line is, you need to be strategic with the company you choose to join. Your time is valuable!</p><p>底线是，你需要对你选择加入的公司保持战略眼光。您的时间很宝贵！</p><p>  I feel strongly that working on three different teams at Twitter helped me gain experience critical to running Lunch Money on my own today. I stayed on each team for roughly 1 year, having made significant impact before moving onto the next.</p><p>我强烈地感觉到，在Twitter的三个不同团队工作帮助我获得了对今天独自管理午餐钱至关重要的经验。我在每个团队都呆了大约一年，在进入下一个团队之前产生了重大影响。</p><p> I started on Observability which was responsible for building a monitoring tool for internal use. I was specifically hired to work on the front-end side of things so I had full autonomy over the UI and UX of these dashboards.</p><p>我从可观察性开始，负责构建供内部使用的监控工具。我是专门受雇在前端工作的，所以我对这些仪表板的UI和UX有完全的自主权。</p><p>  I would have probably stayed on longer if it weren’t for my manager and another team that was looking to “borrow” an engineer for some high priority growth initiatives. My manager volunteered me and I was excited to work on a public-facing project for once. Little did I know there was a breakdown in communication and the receiving team, hearing that I was coming from “Platform Engineering”, assumed that I was a backend and Scala wiz.</p><p>如果不是因为我的经理和另一个团队想要“借用”一名工程师来做一些高优先级的增长计划，我可能会呆得更久。我的经理自愿让我参加一个面向公众的项目，这一次我很兴奋。我一点也不知道沟通出现了故障，接收团队听说我来自“平台工程”，就以为我是后端和Scala高手。</p><p> Despite my initial uneasiness, I tapped into my “fake it til you make it” mentality and I learned Scala on the job. It wasn’t easy going from Javascript to a strongly-typed language but with a few late nights and the help of some very patient engineers, I was able to ship a couple of high impact features. I also ended up being the sole backend engineer supporting the new user onboarding process during the World Cup.</p><p>尽管一开始我感到不安，但我利用了我的“假装直到你成功”的心态，在工作中学会了Scala。从Javascript到强类型语言并非易事，但在几个深夜和一些非常耐心的工程师的帮助下，我得以发布了几个影响很大的功能。在世界杯期间，我还成为支持新用户自注册流程的唯一后端工程师。</p><p> I later switched to the messaging team (working on SMS, push notifications and email) where I rewrote from scratch the entire infrastructure that interpreted text messages.</p><p>后来我转到了消息传递团队(负责短信、推送通知和电子邮件)，在那里我从头开始重写了解释文本消息的整个基础设施。</p><p> All in all, I left Twitter with an incredible breadth and depth of experience– having worked up and down the stack, in both existing codebases and greenfield projects, on my own and under the watchful eye of staff engineers. I gained an unreal amount of confidence in my engineering skills and more importantly, my ability to learn a new technology quickly.</p><p>总而言之，我给Twitter留下了令人难以置信的广度和深度的经验-在现有的代码库和绿地项目中，我独自一人，在员工工程师的密切关注下，在堆栈中上下工作。我对自己的工程技能，更重要的是，我快速学习一项新技术的能力获得了令人难以置信的信心。</p><p>  In my early 20s, I got really into electronic dance music (EDM). I found myself going out dancing most Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. Since San Francisco was home to numerous clubs, it became a chore to discover events. You basically had to go to each individual venue’s (often janky) website and navigate their calendars to find what was coming up. From there, specific event details were either on Facebook or ticketing platforms like Eventbrite, Ticketfly, etc.</p><p>在我20岁出头的时候，我真的迷上了电子舞曲(EDM)。我发现自己大部分周四、周五和周六晚上都出去跳舞。因为旧金山是众多俱乐部的所在地，所以发现活动就成了一件苦差事。基本上，你必须去每个单独会场的网站(通常很简陋)，浏览他们的日程表，才能找到正在进行的活动。从那里，具体的活动细节要么在Facebook上，要么在Eventbrite、Ticketfly等票务平台上。</p><p> I later found out from a friend that there used to be a popular site that aggregated all EDM events in the Bay Area until it eventually shut down. I thought this was a fantastic idea and well within my technical scope so I got to work.</p><p>后来我从一个朋友那里了解到，以前有一个很受欢迎的网站，它聚集了旧金山湾区的所有EDM事件，直到它最终关闭。我认为这是一个很棒的想法，而且完全在我的技术范围内，所以我开始工作。</p><p> I hammered out a minimal viable product (MVP) with Ruby on Rails (thanks to having learned this on the job at Twitter). The MVP was basically a one-pager with a list of manually-inserted events for the next 2 weeks. I started to tell my friends about the site and it quickly proved invaluable.</p><p>我用Ruby on rails敲定了一个最低限度的可行产品(MVP)(这要归功于我在Twitter工作时学到的)。MVP基本上是一个单页传呼机，上面列出了接下来的两周手动插入的事件列表。我开始告诉我的朋友关于这个网站的事情，它很快被证明是无价的。</p><p>  Fuelled by passion, I poured hours of effort every week into growing my site. I learned to incorporate the Gracenote API which would label each event with the specific genre of EDM. The Eventbrite and Ticketfly APIs helped automate adding new event details. I implemented a form where promoters could suggest upcoming shows. I started a Facebook page which grew to hundreds of followers. I sent out weekly emails via Mailchimp and made a few bucks every month with affiliate ads.</p><p>在激情的推动下，我每周投入数小时的精力来发展我的网站。我学会了合并Gracenote API，它会将每个事件标记为特定类型的EDM。Eventbrite和TicketFly API帮助自动添加新的事件详细信息。我实现了一个表单，发起人可以在其中建议即将到来的节目。我在脸书上创建了一个页面，现在已经有数百名粉丝了。我每周通过邮件黑猩猩发送电子邮件，每个月通过会员广告赚几块钱。</p><p> Over the course of several months, word of mouth continued to spread and my site ultimately peaked at 1000 weekly active users.</p><p>在几个月的时间里，口碑继续传播，我的网站最终达到了每周1000名活跃用户的顶峰。</p><p>  The coolest part (which I’ve yet to re-experience with Lunch Money) was when I met someone at a show. I asked them if they had heard of my site and they pulled up their phone to show me it was the last site they had visited. That blew my mind!</p><p>最酷的部分(我还没有用午餐钱重新体验过)是当我在一场演出中遇到某人的时候。我问他们是否听说过我的网站，他们拿起手机给我看，这是他们最后一次访问的网站。这让我大吃一惊！</p><p> The eventual fade of my interest in EDM also meant the end of futuraretro. While it didn’t get anywhere significant, I strengthened my muscle of “learning by doing”. Since then, I’ve started a number of other micro-sites spawned from short-lived curiosities and interests. My first few projects did not end up being the breakthrough ones but they helped me get used to putting myself out there and launching things.</p><p>我对EDM的兴趣最终消退了，这也意味着未来旅行的结束。虽然没有取得什么重大进展，但我加强了“边做边学”的力量。从那时起，我已经创办了许多其他微型网站，这些网站都是由短暂的好奇心和兴趣催生出来的。我最初的几个项目最终并不是突破性的，但它们帮助我习惯了把自己放在那里，开始做事情。</p><p>  Moving out of San Francisco permanently and subsequently taking a sabbatical helped strip away the biases that were stemming from my environment. If you were to ask me when I was living in San Francisco my motivations for wanting to start a company, my honest answer would probably be related to boosting my ego, gaining clout among my Silicon Valley peers, or making a ton of money so I could afford a little condo in the Mission.</p><p>永久搬离旧金山，随后休了一年假，有助于消除源于我所处环境的偏见。如果你问我，当我住在旧金山的时候，我想创办一家公司的动机是什么，我诚实的回答可能是增强我的自尊心，在硅谷同龄人中获得影响力，或者赚很多钱，这样我就可以买得起在使命酒店的一套小公寓。</p><p> I took significant time off to travel in 2017. I sought after experiences I knew I would never come across otherwise such as spending time  in various abodes in Northeastern Thailand and  the French countryside. Being in new and unfamiliar environments helped me see almost right away that I wanted to end up in Toronto. I was reminded of the other joys in life– family, nature and community, and  I gained clarity on myself.</p><p>2017年，我花了很长时间去旅行。我在寻找一些我知道在其他地方永远不会遇到的经历，比如在泰国东北部和法国乡村的各种住所度过时间。身处陌生的新环境让我几乎立刻意识到，我想要在多伦多结束自己的旅程。我想起了生活中的其他乐趣-家庭、自然和社区，我对自己有了清醒的认识。</p><p>  It may seem drastic, but leaving behind all my comforts was my big ‘ah ha!’ moment. I don’t think it changed me as a person, rather, it allowed me to recalibrate for my desired life path without external influences.</p><p>这可能看起来很夸张，但我把所有的舒适抛在脑后的是我最大的一句“啊哈！”时刻。我不认为它改变了我这个人，相反，它让我在没有外界影响的情况下重新调整了我想要的人生道路。</p><p> Now that I have a better footing on my goals and values, I am rebuilding my life around that and I couldn’t be happier. See, if I wanted to make a bunch of money and make a name for myself, I would not be a solopreneur. Solopreneurship optimizes for freedom first, not money. And right now, running Lunch Money as a company of one while living in Taipei is exactly where I want to be.</p><p>现在我在我的目标和价值观上有了更好的基础，我正围绕着这一点重建我的生活，我非常高兴。你看，如果我想赚一大笔钱并让自己出名，我就不会做独唱家了。个人关系首先优化的是自由，而不是金钱。而现在，在台北生活的同时，以一人公司的身份经营午餐钱正是我想要的。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://lunchbag.ca/preparing-for-solopreneurship">https://lunchbag.ca/preparing-for-solopreneurship</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/关系/">#关系</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/preparing/">#preparing</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
