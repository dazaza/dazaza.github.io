Often, these rules are so widespread that they become calcified and beyond negotiation. Today, we focus on an unwritten rule in venture capital— legal fees.</p><p>大多数行业都有不成文的规则，当你第一次了解到这些规则时，你会感到震惊。通常情况下，这些规则是如此普遍，以至于它们变得僵化，无法谈判。今天，我们关注风险投资中的一条不成文规则--律师费。</p><p>  In courtrooms all across the United States, litigants follow ‘  The American Rule’—that is, each party is responsible for paying for their own legal counsel unless (a) there is a specific law that authorizes fees, or (b) the contract includes an attorneys’ fees clause.</p><p>在美国各地的法庭上，诉讼当事人都遵循“美国规则”--也就是说，每一方当事人都有责任支付自己的法律顾问费用，除非(A)有专门的法律授权收费，或者(B)合同中包含律师费条款。</p><p> The VC industry does not follow the American Rule. The unwritten rule is founders must pay for their own attorneys’ fees, plus their VC’s legal fees, up to a negotiated cap.</p><p>风投行业并不遵循美国规则。不成文的规定是，创始人必须支付自己的律师费，加上风投的律师费，最高限额是协商好的。</p><p>  Fee shifting is so pervasive in this industry that it’s often said to be “a standard term” in negotiations. (Remember Morty’s words:   Nothing is standard in venture capital).</p><p>费用转移在这个行业非常普遍，以至于人们经常说它是谈判中的“标准术语”。(记住莫蒂的话：风险投资没有什么是标准的)。</p><p> People will often use this line to justify terms favorable  to them. Can you think of a single time when someone opposite of your position told you “this is a standard term” and it benefited you or your client? If not, then how can we seriously treat this as a standard term? But even if it was a standard term, is it  fair and reasonable?</p><p>人们经常会用这句话来证明对他们有利的条款是合理的。你能想象有哪一次，与你立场相反的人告诉你“这是一个标准术语”，让你或你的客户受益吗？如果不是，那么我们怎么能把它当做一个标准术语来认真对待呢？但是，即使这是一个标准的条款，它是否公平和合理呢？</p><p>  A couple of years ago I had an eye-opening experience with this fee shifting norm. My client was a budding startup looking to close a $2 million Seed investment from a publicly-traded corporation. It was the investor’s first attempt at corporate venture capital. They wanted it done right so they hired a top law firm out of Silicon Valley.</p><p>几年前，我对这种费用变动规范大开眼界。我的客户是一家初创企业，正在寻求完成一家上市公司200万美元的种子投资。这是这位投资者首次尝试企业风险投资。他们想要做好这件事，所以他们从硅谷聘请了一家顶级律师事务所。</p><p>  The only problem was that the deal team they picked also happened to be the same deal team that took the company public. It was an elite group of highly-skilled IPO lawyers who practiced in the public markets, helping clients file their S-1s, doing public due diligence and doing all things necessary to get a company to go public. A difficult job, to be sure, but not exactly related to early-stage investing.</p><p>唯一的问题是，他们挑选的交易团队恰好也是让公司上市的同一个交易团队。这是一个由高技能IPO律师组成的精英团队，他们在公开市场执业，帮助客户提交S-1申请，进行公开尽职调查，并做所有必要的事情，让一家公司上市。可以肯定的是，这是一项艰难的工作，但与早期投资并不完全相关。</p><p> This was also not a cheap bunch of lawyers. The partner charged $1,200 per hour, senior associates ~$900 per hour, and the first and second year associates ~$550+ per hour.  $2 million was probably an average legal fee for them on an IPO deal.</p><p>这也不是一群廉价的律师。合伙人每小时收费1200美元，高级合伙人每小时900美元，第一和第二年合伙人每小时550美元以上。200万美元可能是他们IPO交易的平均律师费。</p><p> By comparison, the top quartile hourly fees charged by corporate attorneys with 10+ years of experience is   $450 per hour. A  lightweight Series Seed deal should cost between $5K and $15K+, an average fee cap is $20K, whereas a heavier-Seed or Series A deal ranges typically between $30K and $65K+. ( Bloomberg Law: Survey of 140+ startups;  see also  Aumni/NVCA Term Sheet).</p><p>相比之下，拥有10年以上经验的公司律师收取的最高时薪为每小时450美元。一笔轻量级种子交易的成本应在5000美元至15K美元之间，平均费用上限为2万美元，而较重的种子或A系列交易的价格通常在3万美元至65K美元以上。(彭博社法律：对140多家初创公司的调查；另请参阅Aumni/NVCA条款说明书)。</p><p>  On our initial kickoff call, the topic of “what legal forms should we use?” came up. Given that it was a light-to-normal Series Seed deal, I suggested  Series Seed documents, originally drafted by Ted Wang/Jason Boehmig while at Fenwick. The lead attorney (let’s call him Frank) disagreed.</p><p>在我们最初的启动电话中，主题是“我们应该使用什么法律形式？”想出来了。考虑到这是一笔从轻到普通的系列赛种子交易，我建议使用系列赛种子文件，最初是由Ted Wang/Jason Boehmig在Fenwick时起草的。首席律师(让我们叫他弗兰克)不同意。</p><p> Frank: “You mean Series Seed DOT COM documents?” he said. “What are you talking about? Those forms haven&#39;t been used around here for over 10 years.”</p><p>弗兰克：“你是说系列种子DOT COM文档？”他说。“你在说什么呢？这些表格已经有10多年没有在这里使用过了。“。</p><p> I explained to Frank that Series Seed “dot com” documents were common for light-to-normal Series Seed deals, including in Silicon Valley today (I had the tweets to prove it!) Frank would hear none of it. To Frank, there was only one option:  NVCA forms.</p><p>我向弗兰克解释说，在从轻到普通的系列种子交易中，系列种子“.com”文档很常见，包括今天在硅谷的交易(我有推文证明了这一点！)。弗兰克什么也不听。对弗兰克来说，只有一个选择：NVCA表格。</p><p> I said, “Frank, if we are going to use the NVCA documents, that&#39;s fine, but we will end up spending 3x more in legal fees.” I sent him guides and articles explaining this and even backed it up with anecdotal evidence.</p><p>我说：“弗兰克，如果我们要使用NVCA的文件，那很好，但我们最终要花3倍的律师费。”我给他寄去了指南和文章，解释了这一点，甚至还提供了轶事证据作为佐证。</p><p>  The full Series A documentation is typically significantly more expensive in legal fees, and requires the negotiation of all the terms and documents that will be used in a later Series A financing. This can be difficult since the seed round often does not include traditional lead investors with which the company can negotiate the documents. This structure of transaction can typically take four to six weeks to complete (from finalization of the term sheet to closing of the investment). —Fenwick &amp; West,  Seed Financing Overview</p><p>完整的首轮融资文件通常在法律费用上要昂贵得多，而且需要就所有条款和文件进行谈判，这些条款和文件将在以后的首轮融资中使用。这可能很困难，因为种子轮通常不包括该公司可以与之谈判文件的传统牵头投资者。这种交易结构通常需要四到六周的时间才能完成(从最终敲定条款说明书到完成投资)。-Fenwick&Amp；West，种子融资概述。</p><p> Frank again disagreed and so I made him an offer: If his client promised that it would charge no more than $15K in attorneys’ fees, then we would agree to use the NVCA forms. Frank agreed, but on the condition that we draft the forms.</p><p>弗兰克再次不同意，所以我向他提出了一个提议：如果他的客户承诺不会收取超过15K美元的律师费，那么我们就会同意使用NVCA表格。弗兰克同意了，但条件是我们要起草表格。</p><p> Although we had  secured a legally enforceable right that no more than $15K in attorneys’ fees would be charged to my client, it didn’t matter. True to form, the IPO deal team ran a heavy due diligence over the next six weeks and amassed a six-figure legal fee. To get the deal done, my client was told it had to cover at least half the deal team’s fee, at which this point was well over six figures. They said the “$15K was a mistake” and the “spirit of the deal was always to cover half of our legal fees.” What’s ironic was that we had only one enforceable term in the term sheet and it was the $15K fee cap.</p><p>虽然我们已经获得了法律上可强制执行的权利，不会向我的当事人收取超过1.5万美元的律师费，但这并不重要。和往常一样，IPO交易团队在接下来的6周里进行了严格的尽职调查，并积累了6位数的律师费。为了完成这笔交易，我的客户被告知必须支付至少一半的交易团队费用，这笔费用远远超过六位数。他们说，“15K美元是个错误”，“协议的精神始终是支付我们一半的律师费。”具有讽刺意味的是，我们在条款说明书中只有一个可执行条款，那就是15K美元的费用上限。</p><p> My client conceded. In the end, Frank got what he wanted and his multi-billion dollar client was more than happy it passed along the costs to my client, the startup that actually needed the funds.</p><p>我的当事人承认了。最后，弗兰克得到了他想要的，他数十亿美元的客户非常高兴将成本转嫁给了我的客户，也就是真正需要资金的初创公司。</p><p> Some time later, after reflecting on the turn of events and the bad taste it left me, I ended up tweeting this out (unfortunately, the real amounts were much higher):</p><p>一段时间后，在反思了事件的转折和它给我留下的糟糕品味后，我最终在推特上写下了这件事(不幸的是，实际金额要高得多)：</p><p>   Obviously, what happened wasn&#39;t fair and it’s been a far outlier from my experience. However, it laid bare the power that VCs and their fund counsel have when compared to founders who either don’t know about or don’t have the leverage to negotiate.</p><p>显然，所发生的事情是不公平的，从我的经验来看，这是一个非常离经叛道的事情。然而，与那些要么不知道，要么没有谈判筹码的创始人相比，这件事暴露了风投和他们的基金法律顾问所拥有的权力。</p><p> There are essentially three camps of how you might view attorneys’ fees clauses in the context of venture capital financings:</p><p>在风险投资的背景下，你可能会如何看待律师费条款，基本上有三个阵营：</p><p>  All venture capitalists are on an annual budget. A lot of people think that VCs have a lot of money to spend on legal fees and miscellaneous expenses. While that might be true at a multi-stage, top tier venture capital fund with in-house counsel and management fees that have stacked up over the years, it’s not true for most VCs. And it’s certainly not true for emerging fund managers who haven’t raised beyond their second or third fund, and for those who have only raised $50 million or less.</p><p>所有的风险资本家都有年度预算。很多人认为风投公司有很多钱可以花在律师费和杂费上。对于一家多阶段的顶级风险投资基金来说，这种情况可能是正确的，但对于大多数风投公司来说，情况并非如此。风险投资基金的内部咨询和管理费多年来一直在不断积累。对于那些没有募集第二只或第三只基金的新兴基金经理，以及那些只募集到5000万美元或更少资金的新兴基金经理来说，情况肯定不是这样。</p><p>  Fund managers also don’t think it’s unfair that founders shoulder some of the burden—because it gives the manager the ability to operate without having to ask for more management fees, which can be seen as a misalignment of interests with their LPs.</p><p>基金经理也不认为创始人承担部分负担是不公平的--因为这让基金经理有能力在不要求更多管理费的情况下运营，这可以被视为与有限合伙人的利益不一致。</p><p> Camp #2: You Understand Both Sides, But You Recognize There’s Bigger Fish to Fry</p><p>阵营2：你理解双方，但你认识到还有更重要的事情要做。</p><p> This camp understands there is a misalignment of interests between founders and venture capitalists and that VCs typically have the power in this imbalance. But when it comes to legal fees, these are necessary costs to get deals done. Standard forms can help mitigate costs, as can legaltech. But in the overall context of venture capital, legal fees are just the cost of doing business. We shouldn’t sweat the small stuff because it gets in the way of important things like company building and venture scaling. Negotiate a cap and stick to it.</p><p>这一阵营明白，创始人和风险资本家之间存在利益失衡，而风投通常在这种失衡中拥有权力。但当谈到法律费用时，这些费用是达成交易所必需的成本。标准表格可以帮助降低成本，LegalTech也可以。但在风险投资的整体背景下，律师费只是做生意的成本。我们不应该为小事而操心，因为它会妨碍公司建设和风险投资规模等重要事情。协商一个上限，并遵守它。</p><p> There is a standard set of legal fees that the venture capital industry follows. It’s a step function for each financing round (chart taken from  Aumni’s Enhanced Term Sheet):</p><p>风险投资行业遵循一套标准的法律费用。这是每轮融资的阶梯函数(图表摘自Aumni的增强条款说明书)：</p><p>   As someone wrote on Twitter recently, “it’s strange how legal fees are just under the cap or way over the cap with copious discounts, but we never see legal fees significantly under.” Given the amount of legal work it should take to get a deal done, it’s an unfortunate, but true cost. Without legaltech, that’s true.</p><p>就像最近有人在推特上写的那样，“奇怪的是，律师费是在上限之下还是在上限之上，而且有大量的折扣，但我们从来没有看到律师费显著低于上限。”考虑到达成交易所需的法律工作量，这是一笔不幸但真实的成本。如果没有LegalTech，这是真的。</p><p> The legal industry is fixated on hourly rates or flat fees with higher than average costs because there hasn’t been a strong push to drive those costs down. First, I don’t think a big law firm model would support lower costs. Second, there are legaltech tools that already help mitigate this, but there isn’t an industry standard. Not yet anyways.</p><p>法律界关注的是时薪或固定费用，其成本高于平均水平，因为没有大力压低这些成本。首先，我认为大型律师事务所模式不会支持降低成本。其次，LegalTech已经有一些工具可以帮助缓解这一问题，但还没有一个行业标准。不管怎么说，现在还不是。</p><p>  As a former founder or someone who empathizes with their lot, you think that startups paying for their VC’s attorneys’ fees is hogwash.</p><p>作为一名前创始人或同情他们命运的人，你认为初创公司支付风投的律师费是无稽之谈。</p><p> Camp #3 believes venture capital funds have the ability to pay for their own expenses, so they should cover their own legal fees. VCs already pay for things like back office fund administration, fund formation fees, operations, accounting, and audit fees. There is no reason these funds can’t also pay for their own legal expenses.</p><p>三号阵营认为，风险投资基金有能力支付自己的费用，因此它们应该支付自己的律师费。风投公司已经支付了后台基金管理、基金组建费用、运营、会计和审计费用等费用。这些基金没有理由不能支付自己的法律费用。</p><p> This camp reminds me of a recent story that Dave Portnoy, founder of Barstool Sports, told to Anthony Pompliano on the Pomp Podcast about a similar experience he faced:</p><p>这个夏令营让我想起了巴斯托尔体育(Barstool Sports)创始人戴夫·波特诺伊(Dave Portnoy)最近在盛大的播客节目中告诉安东尼·庞普利亚诺(Anthony Pompliano)的一个故事，讲述了他面临的类似经历：</p><p> “I remember the Chernin [Group] deal. There was like $50,000 in lawyer fees that I know at the beginning they [promised to] cover my lawyer fees. It’s $50,000. It was a lot of money for me at the time. And we were at the last moment of the deal and they said ‘Yeah, you pay for our lawyer fees.’ And I said no, we agreed that you did. They tried to renegotiate it. And I literally said at the end—I’m like—‘the deal is off.’ They offered $40,000, not $50,000. And I said, ‘It’s $50K or the deal is off because we agreed on it.’ If we agree on something with me, you better fucking honor it, or I will walk.”</p><p>“我还记得切宁(集团)的交易。一开始我知道他们有大约5万美元的律师费，他们(承诺)会支付我的律师费。是5万美元。在当时，这对我来说是一笔很大的钱。我们在交易的最后一刻，他们说‘是的，你付我们的律师费。’我拒绝了，我们都同意你这么做了。他们试图重新谈判。我在最后说--我就像是--‘交易取消了。’他们出价4万美元，而不是5万美元。我说，‘要不然就是5万美元，否则交易就取消了，因为我们达成了协议。’如果我们在某件事上与我意见一致，你最好他妈的尊重它，否则我就走人。“。</p><p>  There are a few VCs in the industry that do not follow the unwritten rules of venture capital, but follow the American Rule instead. These VCs understand the costs that startups face and have undertaken to either completely waive their attorneys’ fees or set a floor before fees kick in—in other words, if the parties go over a certain agreed-upon threshold ($20K-30K, for example), then the startup pays for or splits those costs above that threshold amount.</p><p>业内有少数风投公司不遵循风险投资的不成文规则，而是遵循美国规则。这些风投公司了解初创公司面临的成本，并承诺要么完全免除律师费，要么在律师费生效之前设定一个下限--换句话说，如果双方超过了某个商定的门槛(比如200K-3万美元)，那么初创公司就会支付或分摊超过这个门槛的成本。</p><p>   * If you (or someone you know) are a venture capital firm that does not charge its founders attorneys fees, please reach out to me as I will update this article over time.</p><p>*如果你(或你认识的人)是一家不向创始人收取律师费的风险投资公司，请联系我，因为我会随着时间的推移更新这篇文章。</p><p>   If you&#39;ve already subscribed, thank you so much—I appreciate it! 🙏   As always, if you&#39;d like to drop me a note, you can email me at chris@harveyesq.com, reach me at  my law firm’s website or find me on Twitter at  @chrisharveyesq.</p><p>如果你已经订阅了，非常感谢--我很感激！在🙏上，如果你想一如既往地给我留言，你可以发电子邮件给我：chris@harveyesq.com，或者通过我的律师事务所网站联系我，或者在推特上找到我：@chrisharveyesq。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://lawofvc.substack.com/p/12-episode-the-un-american-rule">https://lawofvc.substack.com/p/12-episode-the-un-american-rule</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/风险投资/">#风险投资</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/rule/">#rule</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/律师费/">#律师费</a></button></div></div><div class="shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded clearfix"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm"><div><a target="_blank" href="/story/1033675.html"><img src="http://img2.diglog.com/img/2020/11/thumb_94fddf7252d954dad940fd11b026b416.png" class="img-fluid" onerror="this.style.display='none'"></a></div><div class="item_title"><a target="_blank" href="/story/1033675.html">劳普风险投资公司(Loup Ventures)</a></div><span class="my_story_list_date">2020-11-7 14:21</span></div><div class="col-sm"><div><a target="_blank" href="/story/1033443.html"><img src="http://img2.diglog.com/img/2020/11/thumb_117e26ff66eeec5136783ec848c4fa94.jpg" class="img-fluid" onerror="this.style.display='none'"></a></div><div class="item_title"><a target="_blank" href="/story/1033443.html">
