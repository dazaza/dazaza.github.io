The thing I reached for: a search function.</p><p>一年多一点，因为Covid-19锁定开始扇动全球范围，大多数人都抓住卫生纸和罐头食品。我达成的东西：搜索功能。</p><p> The purpose of the search function was somewhat irrelevant. I simply needed to code. Code soothes because it can provide control in moments when the world seems to spiral. Reductively, programming consists of little puzzles to be solved. Not just inert jigsaws on living room tables, but puzzles that breathe with an uncanny life force. Puzzles that make things happen, that get things done, that automate tedium or allow for the publishing of words across the world.</p><p> 搜索功能的目的有点无关紧要。我只是需要代码。代码舒缓，因为当世界似乎螺旋时，它可以在瞬间提供控制。还原，编程包括很少的谜题。不仅仅是在客厅桌上的惰性拼图，而且令人兴奋的是不可思议的生命力。让事情发生的谜题，让事情变得搞定，这使得勇气自动化或允许在世界上发表的单词。</p><p> Like many other writers and artists, I maintain a personal website. My current one has been active for nearly 20 years. Code in mind, I brushed off my rusty JavaScript skills and started to poke around for fuzzy-search libraries I could bolt onto my homepage, to make it easy to find specific essays from my collection.</p><p> 像许多其他作家和艺术家一样，我维护一个个人网站。我目前的一直活跃近20年。考虑到代码，我刷掉了我生锈的JavaScript技巧，并开始戳灭模糊搜索图书馆我可以螺栓上我的主页，让您可以轻松找到来自我的收藏品的特定论文。</p><p>  Break the problem into pieces. Put them into a to-do app (I use and love Things). This is how a creative universe is made. Each day, I’d brush aside the general collapse of society that seemed to be happening outside of the frame of my life, and dive into search work, picking off a to-do. Covid was large; my to-do list was reasonable.</p><p>  打破问题成碎片。把它们放入Do Do应用程序（我使用和爱事物）。这就是创造性宇宙的制作方式。每天，我都会刷掉社会的一般崩溃，似乎发生在我生命框架之外，并潜入搜查工作，挑选一个待办事项。 covid很大;我的待办事项列表是合理的。</p><p> The real joy of this project wasn’t just in getting the search working but the refinement, the polish, the edge bits. Getting lost for hours in a world of my own construction. Even though I couldn’t control the looming pandemic, I could control this tiny cluster of bits.</p><p> 这个项目的真正快乐不仅仅是在获得搜索工作，而是细化，波兰，边缘位。在我自己建设的世界里迷失了几个小时。即使我无法控制迫在眉睫的大流行，我也可以控制这个小簇的比特。</p><p>  The whole process was an escape, but an escape with forward momentum. Getting the keyboard navigation styled just right, shifting the moment the search payload was delivered, finding a balance of index size and search usefulness. And most important, keeping it all light, delightfully light. And then writing it up, making it a tiny “gist” on GitHub, sharing with the community. It’s like an alley-oop to others: Go ahead, now  you use it on your website.  Super fast, keyboard-optimized, client side Hugo search.</p><p>  整个过程都是一种逃脱，但逃脱了前锋势头。获取键盘导航恰到好处，转移搜索有效载荷的瞬间，找到索引大小的余额和搜索有用性。最重要的是，保持所有光，令人愉快的光线。然后写它，在github上做一个小的“gist”，与社区分享。这就像一个别人的小巷：继续，现在你在网站上使用它。超快速，键盘优化，客户端Hugo搜索。</p><p>   The point being that a habit of reaching for code is not only healing for the self, but a trick to transmute a sense of dread into something: A function that seems to add, however trivially, a small bit of value to the greater whole in a troubling moment.</p><p>   这一点是达到代码的习惯不仅为自己愈合，而且一个戏剧性的戏法变成了某种东西：似乎增加了一个函数，但是，这是一个少量的价值到更大的总体一个令人不安的时刻。 </p><p> I began coding when I was 10 and have been running with it ever since. Self-taught, mostly. I had a preternatural awkwardness with others. The machine was literal in a reassuring way, and seemed to promise access to a world that even the adults around me couldn’t fathom. In this way, the code became a friend—a nonjudgmental buddy.</p><p>当我10岁时，我开始编码，从那时起就已经跑了。自学，大多数。我对别人有一个尴尬的尴尬。这台机器以令人放心的方式，似乎承诺获得一个世界，即使是我周围的成年人也无法幻想。通过这种方式，代码成为一个朋友 - 一个非犹太伙伴。</p><p>  A pattern was set: When the complexities of social situations exhausted me as a child, I turned to code, became an isolate. Ellen Ullman writes in her book  Life in Code: A Personal History of Technology, “Until I became a programmer, I didn’t thoroughly understand the usefulness of such isolation: the silence, the reduction of life to thought and form; for example, going off to a dark room to work on a program when relations with people get difficult.”</p><p>  设定了一种模式：当社会情况的复杂性作为孩子筋疲力尽时，我转向代码，成为一个孤立的孤立。 Ellen Ullman在代码中写下她的书籍生活：个人技术历史，“直到我成为程序员，我并没有彻底了解这种隔离的有用性：沉默，减少生命的思想和形式;例如，当与人们的关系变得困难时，将在一个暗室上工作。“</p><p> Reading assembly language books in middle school or programming BBS software in high school didn’t register, then, explicitly, as a salve. My first conscious acknowledgement of the palliative power of code came a few years ago when I refactored my website from one content management system to another. This sounds implausible, but it’s true: I was healed by a CMS, a Google-unique phrase—and for good reason.</p><p> 在中学的阅读汇编语言书籍或在高中编程BBS软件没有注册，然后明确地注册，作为一个药膏。我的第一次意识地确认代码的姑息力量是几年前，当我将我的网站从一个内容管理系统重构到另一个内容管理系统时，几年前出现了。这听起来难以置信，但这是真的：我被CMS医治，一个谷歌独特的短语 - 以及充分理由。</p><p> At the time, I was suffering from personal and professional depressions, a long time in the making. I had been knocked off kilter. When I took stock of my mind, I realized it was not where I wanted or expected it to be.</p><p> 当时，我患有个人和职业萧条，很长一段时间在制作中。我被击倒了千克。当我拿到我的脑海里时，我意识到它不是我想要的地方或期待它。</p><p>  This happens to me, sometimes; to certain people, many times. I think often of the epigraph of William Styron’s  Darkness Visible when I feel the weight of a depression descend: “For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me …” That descent usually means I haven’t been getting enough rest. I don&#39;t mean over the course of days, but rather months or years. A slow tilting, like a ship taking on water through a pinhole. Given enough time, it must tip. My mind was tipping, and I found myself grasping for, of all things, servers. Like a life raft. Servers, it turns out, are one of my safe places.</p><p>  有时会发生在我身上;对某些人多次。当我觉得沮丧的重量下降时，我觉得威廉·斯科顿的黑暗中的末端可见：“对于我大大担心的东西来到我......”那个下降通常意味着我没有得到足够的休息。我不在几天或几年内均衡。一个缓慢的倾斜，就像一艘穿过针孔的船。给予足够的时间，必须提示。我的思绪在倾斜，我发现自己抓住了所有东西，服务器。像生活木筏一样。事实证明，服务器是我安全的地方之一。</p><p>  I had wanted to shed my rickety and overpriced Rackspace server for years, but had been too lazy. It&#39;s a meaty task, a task for grunts, thankless, and one that requires focus.</p><p>  我想要揭示我的摇摇晃晃的Rackspace服务器多年，但是过于懒惰。它＆＃39;是一个肉体的任务，一项任务为咕噜声，毫无疑问，还有一个需要焦点的任务。</p><p> Most everything related to servers happens in the “terminal,” on the command line, in a world devoid of images or graphical interfaces. Just text. Every action is key-precise and hyper-literal. A mistype of a single character can destroy a system. In fact, for decades, servers have presented the following message when you enter into administrator or “super user” mode:</p><p> 大多数与服务器相关的所有内容发生在命令行中的“终端”中，在没有图像或图形接口的世界中。只是文字。每个动作都是重点精确和超文字。一个字符的错误可以破坏系统。事实上，几十年来，当您进入管理员或“超级用户”模式时，服务器介绍了以下消息： </p><p> We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:</p><p>我们相信您已从本地系统管理员收到通常的讲座。它通常归结为这三件事：</p><p>    It can make a person weak in the knees to think about how much of the world&#39;s smooth operation is contingent on typing accuracy. But it is, and when you move through the guts of your favorite Linux operating system distribution, you can&#39;t help but stare gape-mouthed at the absurdity and beauty of the crisscross threads that keep the web and most of our digital (and, by proxy, physical) infrastructure afloat.</p><p>    它可以让一个人在膝盖中思考世界上的大部分顺利运行都取决于键入准确性。但它是，当你通过你最喜欢的Linux操作系统分销的肠道时，你可以＆＃39; T帮助，但盯着荒凉的线条的荒谬和美丽，让网络和大多数数字（并且，通过代理，物理）基础​​设施漂浮。</p><p> Therein lies part of the attraction: Moving through that jumble—with all of its perverted poetics of  grep and  vi and  git and  apache and *.ini—*and doing so with a fingers-floating-across-the-keyboard balletic grace, is exhilarating. You feel like an alchemist. And you are. You type esoteric words— near gibberish—into a line-by-line text interface, and with a rush not unlike pulling Excalibur from the stone you&#39;ve just scaffolded a simple application that can instantly be accessed by a vast number of humans worldwide.</p><p> 其中谎言的一部分吸引力：通过这种混乱的诗歌和vi和git和apache和* .ini- *并用手指浮动 - 键盘的波动恩典的所有变态的诗学令人振奋的。你觉得自己像个炼金术士。而你是。您键入eSoteric单词 - 靠近Gibberish-逐行文本界面，并且匆忙与从石头上拉出的excalibur与石头＆＃39; ve只是脚手架的一个简单的应用程序，可以通过大量的人类立即访问全世界。</p><p> Romantic partners have regarded me with confusion and perhaps suspicion when I suddenly went fluent in  bash (a flavor of terminal shell used to type commands). It was as if I had been keeping a dirty secret from them. I once dropped quick-fingered into text-land to help a friend&#39;s teenage son install some Minecraft mods, and by the look in his eyes I could tell I had become a minor celebrity in real time. With a few hundred keystrokes, two generations were bridged.</p><p> 当我突然流利地走出抨击时，浪漫的合作伙伴对我感到困惑，也许怀疑（用于键入命令的终端壳牌的风味）。好像我一直留下肮脏的秘密。我曾经把速指伸出剪指，以帮助朋友＆＃39; S少女的少女安装一些MINECRAFT Mods，并在他的眼中，我可以告诉我已经实时成为一个小名人。用几百个击键，两代人桥梁。</p><p> I find peace in the dark mess of that world. Code and servers are a home to me in a way that&#39;s difficult to explain to anyone for whom they are not.</p><p> 我在那个世界的黑暗混乱中找到了和平。代码和服务器是我难以向他们的任何人解释的方式给我的家。</p><p> So in my tilted state, my slightly depressive state, I moved websites from my old server to my new server. My tasks were guided by the trusty to-do list. URLs of old sites marked off distinct epochs in my life, of a variety of lenses through which I once saw myself.  Perhaps I am this kind of artist or will be this kind of writer?</p><p> 所以在我倾斜的状态下，我略微抑郁的状态，我从旧服务器移动到我的新服务器。我的任务是由可靠的待办事项列表指导。旧网站的URL标志着我生命中的不同时期，其中各种镜头，我曾经看到过自己。也许我是这种艺术家，也许是这种作家？</p><p>  The old websites of mine are ghosts. Nobody will look at or think to hunt them down. I moved them because I feel a stewardship over them, feel that they have a right to go on living in bits.</p><p>  我的旧网站是鬼魂。没有人会看看或认为追捕它们。我搬了他们，因为我感受到他们的管家，觉得他们有权继续生活。 </p><p>  A lot of this server work involved making complicated sites less complex. That is: Making the dynamic static. Gutting these sites of their PHP cores, Benjamin Buttoning them back into sleepy HTML and CSS, making them low maintenance and future friendly. It&#39;s funny how even something as simple as a MYSQL database requires pruning, nurture. How a PHP script—so seemingly innocuous!—is rendered obsolete a decade later as deprecation creeps, mental models of languages evolve. But take a page of HTML from the early ’90s, and it renders as well as ever on most anything with a screen.</p><p>许多服务器工作涉及使复杂的网站更加复杂。那是：制作动态静态。将这些网站塑造了他们的PHP核心，本杰明将它们扣回昏昏欲睡的HTML和CSS，使其保持低维护和未来友好。它＆＃39;很有趣，因为MySQL数据库需要修剪，培育，甚至如何简单。如何如何似乎是似乎无害的！ - 渲染后几十年后作为弃用蠕变，语言的心理模型进化。但是从90年代早期拍摄了HTML的一页，它呈现出屏幕的大多数东西。</p><p> In that spirit, as I moved my  homepage I also rebuilt it as a so-called static site. A simpler version that should continue to work for the next hundred years. It looks nearly the same as it did before. With static sites, we&#39;ve come full circle, like exhausted poets who have travelled the world trying every form of poetry and realizing that the haiku is enough to see most of us through our tragedies.</p><p> 在那种精神，当我搬家的主页时，我也将它重建为所谓的静态站点。一个更简单的版本，应该继续在未来百年工作。它看起来与之前几乎相同。与静态站点，我们来了全圈，就像疲惫的诗人，他曾经旅行过世界各种形式的诗歌并意识到Haiku足以通过我们的悲剧看到我们大多数人。</p><p> As is true for most infrastructure work, these gruntish behind-the-scenes tasks are often neglected, or derided as irrelevant, underfunded, ignored. That is, until they break, or a pandemic hits, and then we realize how infrastructure is everything, and without it our world reverts to some troglodytic cave state, or perhaps worse, an ever-widening extreme of haves and have-nots.</p><p> 对于大多数基础架构工作而言，这些故意幕后的任务往往被忽视，或者被嘲笑为无关紧要的，忽视。这是，直到他们打破或大流行点击，然后我们意识到基础设施是一切，而且没有它，我们的世界恢复到一些Troglodytic洞穴状态，或者可能更糟糕的是，一个宽敞的胃果极端。</p><p> In the late 1990s you almost had no choice but to be your own homepage steward and janitor and systems engineer. Now you can offload that stewardship to a third party. Tumblr, Ghost, Facebook, Blogger, Wordpress—platforms have sprung up where you can focus purely on content in exchange for giving up a certain level of control.</p><p> 在20世纪90年代后期，您甚至别无选择，只能成为您自己的主页管家和门垫和系统工程师。现在，您可以卸载到第三方的管理。 Tumblr，Ghost，Facebook，Blogger，Wordpress-Platforms的纯粹在哪里可以纯粹地关注内容以换取放弃一定程度的控制。</p><p> You can take stewardship too far. I probably have. There is a diminishing return on what you can get out of any system, regardless of how much you put into it. But I don&#39;t care.</p><p> 你可以带着管道太远。我可能有。无论您进入多少系统，您都可以退出任何系统的回报递减。但我不在乎。</p><p> This work of line-by-line problem solving gets me out of bed some days. Do you know this feeling? The not-wanting-to-emerge-from-the-covers feeling? Every single morning of the last year may have been the most collectively experienced covers-craving in human history, where so many things in the world were off by a degree here or a degree there. But under those covers I begin to think— A ha! I know how to solve server problem x, or quirk y. I know how to fix that search code. And I&#39;m able to emerge and become human, or part human, and enter into that line-by-line world, where there is very little judgement, just you and the mechanics of the systems, systems that become increasingly beautiful the more time you spend with them. For me, this stewardship is therapy.</p><p> 逐行问题的工作解决了一些日子让我起床。你知道这种感觉吗？从封面的不想出现的感觉？去年每天上午都可能是人类历史上最常见的封面，世界上很多东西都在这里或有一定程度的学位。但在那些掩盖下，我开始思考 - 一个哈！我知道如何解决服务器问题x，或quirk y。我知道如何修复该搜索代码。我能够出现并成为人类，也是人类的，进入那种逐行的世界，在那里有很少的判断力，只是你和系统的机制，变得越来越美丽的系统更多的时间你和他们一起度过。对我来说，这个管家是治疗。</p><p> And so I pull apart a system—a system that I have loved and has served me well over the years—and figure out a better, more sustainable framework for the code, and one hopes, by extension, maybe even the world.</p><p> 所以我把一个系统分开 - 一个我所爱的系统，多年来为我提供了好处 - 并弄清楚一个更好，更可持续的代码框架，一个希望通过扩展，甚至是世界。 </p><p>   🎧 Things not sounding right?
