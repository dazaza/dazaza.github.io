He’d sacrificed a lot to be a pro gamer, dropping out of high school to practice  Overwatch for up to 18 hours a day. When the Houston Outlaws tapped him to play  Overwatch professionally in 2017, he was thrilled. It seemed like his efforts had finally earned him his dream job. Then, reality struck.</p><p>卢卡斯“Mendo”Håkansson正在玩视频游戏，但他没有愉快的时光。他牺牲了很多才能成为一个专业游戏玩家，从高中辍学，每天练习矫正长达18个小时。当休斯顿的歹徒在2017年专业地击中了他的矫枉过正时，他很激动。看起来他的努力终于赢得了他的梦想工作。然后，现实袭来了。</p><p> There’s a reason why esports pros are called athletes. Håkansson’s schedule with the Outlaws was rigid. He woke up, warmed up, and then spent the rest of the day practicing  Overwatch in a tiny, windowless room. “It was honestly a miserable experience being there,” he said. His contract limited when he could stream on Twitch; he says he had to keep the focus on the league, not himself. And always, there was the looming fear that if Activision Blizzard,  Overwatch’s publisher, tweaked the game too much, he’d have to relearn his top characters—or be out of a job.</p><p> 竞争专业人士称为运动员有一个原因。 Håkansson与offaws的日程表很严格。他醒来，温暖了，然后在一个小小的窗口的房间里度过了剩下的练习。 “老实说，这是一个悲惨的经历，”他说。他的合同有限公司，当他可以在抽搐时流动;他说他不得不把重点放在联盟上，而不是自己。并且总是，有迫在眉睫的恐惧，如果激活暴雪，overwatch的出版商，太多调整了游戏，他必须重新安排他的顶部字符 - 或者没有工作。</p><p> After a season in the  Overwatch League, Håkansson quit esports to become a full-time content creator instead. He was quickly  signed by another esports organization, Team Liquid—not just to compete, but to grow his celebrity as a gaming influencer. These days he plays another shooter, Riot Games’  Valorant, on Twitch, where he has 621,000 followers. Håkansson says he is happier and more stable now, and although the  Overwatch League has increased its focus on player well-being, he predicts that more athletes will follow his path. (The league did not respond to our request for comment.) “I think that most people who can, will, if they haven’t already. And a lot of people already have.”</p><p> 在矫枉过正的联赛中一个赛季之后，Håkansson退出了Esports成为全职内容创造者。他很快被另一个Esports组织签署，团队液体 - 不仅仅是为了竞争，而是将他的名人作为游戏影响者发展。这几天他扮演另一个射击游戏，骚乱游戏的Valorant，在抽搐，他有621,000名粉丝。 Håkansson说，他现在更幸福，虽然矫正团联赛增加了重点，但他预测更多的运动员将遵循他的道路。 （联盟没有回应我们对评论的要求。）“我认为大多数人可以，如果他们还没有。很多人已经拥有了。“</p><p> A number of top gamers are quitting esports to pursue what they see as more sustainable careers as Twitch or YouTube personalities. Damon Lau, head of esports at United Talent Agency, says he’s seen a growing number of people make the switch over the past two years. The calculation is simple: They feel they can make more money over the long term and with less grueling schedules by playing games on YouTube or Twitch for their fans. Athletes are looking at their industry, Lau says, and asking themselves, “Why can&#39;t I control my own career and control my own destiny and have the opportunity to build a business around myself?”</p><p> 许多顶级游戏玩家正在退出竞争，以追求他们认为更可持续的职业作为抽搐或YouTube人物。达蒙·卢（Damon Lau）联合人才机构的Esports负责人表示，他看到了越来越多的人在过去两年中开关。计算很简单：他们觉得他们可以通过在YouTube或Twitch上玩游戏来赚取更多的资金，并且通过对粉丝的抽搐玩游戏。运动员正在看着他们的行业，刘说，并询问自己，“为什么可以控制自己的职业生涯并控制自己的命运，并有机会在自己身边建立业务？”</p><p>  The shift goes beyond a couple dozen burned-out esports pros. Esports organizations, game publishers, and even sponsors are also slowly reallocating attention and resources from competitive tournaments to video game streamers. The movements reflect, at least in part,  serious concerns among esports professionals about the health of their industry, and several told WIRED that they’re investing more in gaming content creators or influencers as a way to diversify their business.</p><p>  转变超出了几十人烧毁的竞争专业人士。 esports组织，游戏发布商，甚至赞助商也在缓慢地将竞争锦标赛中的关注和资源慢慢地重新分配给视频游戏流乐器。这些运动至少部分地反映了关于他们行业健康的Esports专业人士的严重关切，有些人告诉有线，他们在游戏内容创造者或影响者中投入更多的方式，以实现他们的业务的方式。</p><p>  The esports industry  brought in about $1 billion in 2020, according to gaming analytics firm NewZoo. However, historically there’s a lot of skepticism around big numbers associated with esports. For a 2018  report, sources told  Kotaku that they believed most organizations’ valuations were inflated. While organized tournaments have drawn crowds of thousands to major arenas, and can reach substantial online audiences via YouTube and Twitter, revenue from live events is typically not enough to recoup their substantial cost. (This was the case even before Covid-19 shut down most large in-person gatherings, although—as in other industries—the pandemic has also accelerated many trends.) Construction costs for esports stadiums or fees for renting arenas are enormous. Players’ salaries can be gargantuan, often over six figures. Plus, buy-ins to big leagues for games like  League of Legends or  Call of Duty cost millions or tens of millions of dollars. Speaking with WIRED, two sources say most esports orgs operate at a loss.</p><p>  根据博彩分析公司Newzoo的说法，Esports行业在2020年收购了大约10亿美元。然而，从历史上看，与ESPorts相关的大量大量有很多怀疑。对于2018年的报告，消息人士们告诉Kotaku，他们认为大多数组织的估值夸大了。虽然有组织的锦标赛将数千人群体绘制到主要的竞技场，并且可以通过YouTube和Twitter达到大量的在线观众，Live Events的收入通常不足以收回其大量成本。 （即使在Covid-19关闭最大的内部聚会之前，这是如此 - 虽然 - 在其他行业 - 大流行也加速了许多趋势。球员的工资可以是棒状，通常超过六个数字。此外，对大联盟的大联盟或召唤票据的大联盟或数千万美元的召唤。与有线说话，两个消息人士称，大多数Esports Orgs陷入亏损。</p><p>  Publishers too are struggling to recoup their investment in esports. Riot Games head of esports Chris Greeley told WIRED that Riot is “approaching breakeven” on its esports endeavors. And in an earnings document revealed during its trial against Apple last week, Epic Games  said it overestimated its opportunities in esports by $154 million in 2019—the year it ran its $30 million cash-prize  Fortnite World Cup.</p><p>  出版商也在努力收回他们对Esports的投资。 Riot Games Head of Esports Chris Greeley告诉有线，骚乱是“接近Breakeven”的Esports努力。在上周审判苹果股份期间透露的盈利文件中，史诗般的奥运会表示，它在2019年 -  2019年兑美元的竞技场的竞技机会高估了它 - 这一年度其3000万美元的现金奖富国世界杯。 </p><p>  Greeley says that esports is not some stretched-out bubble ready to burst. However, he says, “I think you&#39;re going to see a bunch of folks who are pivoting or shifting direction or shifting strategy to continue to move forward, the way any startup industry tends to do.”</p><p>格里特说，Esports并不是一些伸展的泡沫准备爆发。然而，他说，“我觉得你＆＃39;重新看到一堆正在枢转或转移方向或移位策略继续前进的人，任何创业行业往往会做的方式。”</p><p>  Esports organizations typically associated with tournaments are now signing more deals with content creators. (Several top teams declined to comment on this over email.) Instead of competing as part of an  Apex Legends or  Counter-Strike: Global Offensive roster, these gaming influencers stream on Twitch or YouTube, sometimes just chatting with fans and sometimes playing games at a high level. As part of their  partnership agreements, teams help manage these gamers’ businesses, facilitate sponsorship deals, and even provide salaries.</p><p>  esports组织通常与锦标赛相关联的组织现在正在签署更多关于内容创作者的交易。 （几个顶级团队通过电子邮件拒绝发表评论。）而不是作为Apex传说或反恐精英的一部分竞争：全球进攻名册，这些游戏影响者在抽搐或Youtube上流，有时只是与粉丝聊天，有时会在玩游戏高水平。作为合伙协议的一部分，团队帮助管理这些游戏玩家的企业，促进赞助优惠，甚至提供工资。</p><p> Fielding a roster of YouTube or Twitch celebrities can help teams attract more sponsorship deals, which still make up a significant part of their bottom line. Influencers tend to have larger and more engaged audiences than individual athletes, entire teams, and even whole tournaments. A  Call of Duty League tournament might get 70,000 gamers to tune in, but a top streamer like Timothy “TimTheTatMan” Betar approximates that on any given day. For brands weighing where to put their money, those kinds of metrics make the choice easy.</p><p> Foreing Firesing Youtube或抽搐名人的名册可以帮助团队吸引更多的赞助优惠，这仍然构成了他们底线的重要组成部分。影响因素往往比各个运动员，整个团队甚至整个锦标赛更大，更富有更多的受众。致命联盟锦标赛的召唤可能会获得70,000个游戏玩家来调整，但像蒂莫西“Timthetatman”贝达一样的顶级拖网会近似于任何一天。对于称重填写金钱的品牌，这些指标可以轻松选择。</p><p> “What we’ve seen with esports so far is that there’s not clear winners. There’s still a lot of churn.”</p><p> “到目前为止，我们对Esports看到的是没有明确的赢家。还有很多潮流。“</p><p> Sign up for the latest gaming tips, reviews, and features, in your inbox every week.</p><p> 注册您每周收件箱中的最新游戏提示，评论和功能。</p><p> By signing up you agree to our  User Agreement and  Privacy Policy &amp; Cookie Statement</p><p> 通过注册即表示您同意我们的用户协议和隐私政策＆amp; cookie声明</p><p> “It’s all about return on investment,” says Corsair CEO Andy Paul. “What we’ve seen with esports so far is that there’s not clear winners. There’s still a lot of churn.” Corsair’s marketing budget has gone up recently, and Paul says his team has been dedicating a higher percentage of it to influencers relative to esports teams. It represents a shift in Corsair’s sponsorship strategy from esports to content creation. Content creators are more charismatic, easier to identify with. “Once you get an emotional connection with somebody, you’re going to trust them when they say, ‘I’ve been checking out this microphone, and it really sounds good.’” If a streamer is on camera for eight hours using a Corsair keyboard, that’s a lot of exposure for the company. Under the stream, there is an affiliate link. At an esports tournament, meanwhile, it is more challenging for companies like Corsair to measure how many times the camera flicks over to a sponsored player’s headset.</p><p> “这都是关于投资回报，”Corsair首席执行官安迪保罗说。 “到目前为止，我们对Esports看到的是没有明确的赢家。还有很多潮流。“ Corsair的营销预算最近已经上涨，保罗表示，他的团队一直致力于相对于Esports团队的影响力较高。它代表了Corsair的赞助战略从Esports到内容创建的转变。内容创建者更加魅力，更容易识别。 “一旦你和某人的情感联系，当他们说话时，你就会相信他们，”我一直在检查这个麦克风，它真的听起来很好。“如果拖车在相机上使用八个小时Corsair Keyboard，这对公司进行了很多曝光率。在流下，有一个联盟链接。同时，在竞技场竞技场，对Corsair这样的公司更具挑战性，以衡量相机录入为赞助的球员耳机的次数。 </p><p> Publishers—for whom esports is, at base, a  marketing exercise—also have a lot to gain from an industry trend toward gaming celebrities. Both  Fortnite publisher Epic Games and Riot, with its new shooter  Valorant, are taking a more influencer-focused approach to esports.  Fortnite’s 2020 Creator Cup gave viewers prizes for rooting for and watching their Twitch streamer of choice. For  Valorant, which does not yet have a franchised league, Riot Games is supporting third-party tournaments for both content creators and esports stars. The publisher is also hosting watch parties, with top streamers like Tyler “Ninja” Blevins and Michael “Shroud” Grzesiek airing tournaments on their own streams and watching along with their fans (and sometimes earning more viewers than Riot’s own channel). Riot has several times chosen top streamers over esports pros as co-streamers.</p><p>出版商 - 在基础上，在基础上，营销锻炼 - 也有很多才能从一个行业趋势迈向游戏名人。 Fortnite Publisher Epic Games和Riot既有新的射手valorant，也带着更具影响力的竞争方法。 Fortnite的2020年创作者杯子给了观众奖品，用于寻找并观察他们的抽搐选择。对于尚未拥有特许团联盟的valorant，骚乱游戏是支持内容创作者和竞技演家的第三方锦标赛。该出版商还在托管观看派对，顶级娱乐器，如泰勒“忍者”Blevins和Michael“Shord”Grzesiek播放锦标赛，并与他们的粉丝一起观看（并且有时比骚乱自己的频道获得更多观众）。骚乱有几次选择顶级飘带，以竞争专业的乐观专业人员。</p><p> “Folks on the content-creator side are bringing audiences that might not otherwise watch  Valorant,” says Greeley.</p><p> “内容创建者方面的人们正在带来可能没有其他观察valorant的受众，”格雷利说。</p><p> For esports athletes, the shift comes with some risks. While influencers may help esports attract more sponsorships and viewers, some teams are dropping their rosters entirely for popular games while their bench of content creators balloons. And not every pro gamer who wants to can make their own switch to streaming, the way Håkansson did a few years ago. Succeeding on Twitch or YouTube takes more than some skill headshotting opponents. You need a certain charisma to retain audiences livestreaming when there are so many other options available. “They&#39;re simply just like different careers, even though fundamentally both are still playing video games,” says UTA’s Lau.</p><p> 对于Esports运动员来说，转变带来了一些风险。虽然影响者可能有助于竞争吸引更多的赞助和观众，但有些团队在他们的内容创作者气球的替补席上将他们的名单放在热门游戏中。而不是每一个想要将自己的交换机交往流媒体的专业游戏玩家，几年前就做了几年前。在抽搐或youtube上取得成功需要一些技能爆头对手。当有这么多其他选择可用时，您需要一定的魅力来保留当量即将到来的。 “他们简单地就像不同的职业一样，即使从根本上仍在玩电子游戏，”uta的刘说。“</p><p>  At the same time, esports’ embrace of content creators may open up the industry to new kinds of gamers. Players from underrepresented backgrounds don’t always feel supported in traditional esports leagues, even as they try to diversify. Some of them have found more success, and felt more comfortable, in streaming.</p><p>  与此同时，Esports的内容创作者的拥抱可能会向新种游戏玩家开辟行业。来自不足的背景的球员并不总是在传统的Esports联赛中感到支持，即使他们试图多样化。其中一些人发现了更多的成功，并且在流媒体上感觉更舒服。</p><p> Take Ally Warfield. She was invited to join  Magic: The Gathering’s pro esports league in 2019, after receiving the most tournament points of any woman in the world—as she refers to it, “the discretionary woman invite.” At first she was elated, but then, Warfield says, she had difficulty finding a consistent practice group among other pros, who were mostly older men. She felt extremely alone, especially after the league’s two other women left. (The league did not respond to a request for comment.) Warfield lost her spot in the league earlier this year, and with it her main source of income.</p><p> 采取盟友的战争。她被邀请加入魔法：2019年收集的专业竞技联盟，在世界上任何一个女人的最大锦标赛积分之后 - 因为她指的是它，“酌情妇女邀请。”起初，她被兴高采烈，但随后，战野说，她难以找到一个始终如一的实践小组，其中主要是老年人。她感到非常孤单，特别是在联盟的另外两名女性之后离开了。 （联盟没有回应评论请求。）Warfield今年早些时候在联赛中失去了她的位置，并用她的主要收入来源。</p><p>  “I felt like I was set up for failure just from the get-go,” she says. Now, Warfield streams a variety of games  on Twitch, including  Valorant, and is planning on pursuing it as her full-time job.</p><p>  “我觉得我被设置为失败，只是从Go-Go开始，”她说。现在，Warfield在抽搐的各种游戏中，包括valorant，并计划作为她的全职工作追求它。</p><p> Updated 5-13-2021, 10:58 am EDT: We removed a line from the original story that incorrectly said Epic Games brought celebrities like Travis Scott and Marshmello to compete in Fortnite  for its Icon Series; Scott and Marshmello were in the game to perform music, not play competitively.</p><p> 更新5-13-2021，10:58 AM EDT：我们从原始故事中删除了一条不正确的史诗般的游戏所带来的史诗般的游戏，如Travis Scott和Marshmello这样的名人，以竞争其图标系列的Fortnite;斯科特和马歇梅洛在游戏中进行音乐，不竞争地玩。 </p><p>   🏃🏽‍♀️ Want the best tools to get healthy?
