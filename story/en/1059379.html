His large, squarish yellow Glovo backpack lies next to him, but the order he is about to deliver is from UberEats. For the past few months, Maracucho has been working for both food-delivery apps, because the money he earns from the few hours he is allowed to work for Glovo isn’t enough to live on. Delivery riders like Maracucho have been clamouring for years for better regulations to protect their labour rights. Now regulation is finally coming, even if the change it will bring about is fraught with uncertainty.</p><p>这是巴塞罗那周六的午餐时间，乔塞拉科科乔在市中心的意大利餐厅外等待。他的大型大量的黄色glovo背包在于他旁边，但他即将递送的顺序来自Ubereats。在过去的几个月里，马拉库科一直在为两种食物交付的应用程序工作，因为他从几个小时内获得的钱，他被允许为Glovo工作不足以生活。像马拉科科这样的送货车手一直在克服更好的规定来保护其劳动权利。现在监管终于来了，即使它将带来的变化是不确定性的。</p><p> In the coming months, Spain is  set to approve a trailblazing new law enshrining the labour rights of Spain’s estimated 8,000 delivery riders. In what could set a precedent for other European countries, the law will declare that gig economy riders are wage labourers, and force delivery app companies to open up their algorithmic black boxes to explain to their riders what variables they are using to determine their in-app scores. The labour unions fighting for Spain’s overworked and poorly treated delivery riders see this as a victory. But some worry that the law could have unintended consequences for the many riders who, like José Maracucho, do not have a work permit.</p><p> 在未来几个月内，西班牙设立了批准开拓新法律，阐明西班牙估计的8,000名送货车的劳动权利。在什么可以为其他欧洲国家设定先例，法律将宣布，演出的经济骑手是工资劳动者，并强制交付应用公司开辟他们的算法黑匣子，向他们的骑手解释他们正在使用哪些变量来确定它们的变量来确定它们的变量应用分数。为西班牙而战的工会争取过度劳累，送货驾驶者差价不良，认为这是一个胜利。但有些人担心法律可能对那种像JoséMaracucho这样的许多车手产生意外后果，没有工作许可。</p><p>  When Maracucho arrived in Barcelona from Venezuela in February 2020, aged 19, he heard that the fastest way to find a job was working as a rider for Spanish delivery startup Glovo. He didn’t have the necessary papers to work, but he found a Spanish local who rented him his Glovo account to work. He got a bike and started delivering almost immediately. “I started working with Glovo because it’s the easiest thing you can get when you arrive without documents,” Maracucho says. With the rented account, Maracucho could work as many hours as he wished, but he had to pay 30 percent of his earnings to the man he rented it from. The account’s owner also rented it to four more people, so that this particular Glovo account was constantly delivering orders.</p><p>  当Maracucho于2020年2月抵达委内瑞拉的巴塞罗那时，他听说找到工作的最快方式是为西班牙送货启动Glovo工作的骑手。他没有必要的论文来工作，但他找到了一位西班牙本地人，他租了他的加沃福账户来工作。他有一辆自行车，开始立即交付。 “我开始与Glovo一起使用，因为在没有文件的情况下到达时，你可以获得最简单的事情，”马拉科乔说。通过租用的账户，马拉科科可以在他所希望的时候工作，但他不得不向他租用它的人支付30％的盈利。账户的所有者还将其租到了四个人，以便此特定的Glovo账户不断提供订单。</p><p> Last December, Maracucho managed to regularise his situation and also obtained his own account, but his income plummeted. This was because Glovo, apart from decreasing the rates during the pandemic, did not allow him to work more than two hours per day. The app operates using a points-based system, so that when a new rider gets a license Glovo only gives them a score of 90 points out of 100. In order to earn the right to work more hours, Maracucho needs to increase his score – with 95 points you can work between four and eight hours a day, according to riders’ estimates. “You have to work very hard to increase your points and get more hours, and that’s why I combine working at Glovo with working at UberEats,&#34; Maracucho says.</p><p> 去年12月，Maracucho设法正规化了他的情况，并获得了自己的账户，但他的收入崩溃了。这是因为传动会，除了在大流行期间降低利率，不允许他每天工作超过2小时。该应用程序使用基于点的系统进行操作，以便当新的骑手获取许可证上，只能让他们超过100分的分数90分。为了获得更多工作时间的权利，马拉科诺需要增加他的分数 - 根据骑士的估计，您可以在每天四到八小时工作95分。 “你必须很难增加你的积分并获得更多时间，这就是为什么我合并在Glovo工作，在Ubereats工作，＆＃34;马拉库科说。</p><p>  Glovo’s algorithm establishes a rider’s score. To determine the score – and increase it – the company relies on factors such as delivery speed, customer rating or availability to take orders at any time, alongside other factors not shared with riders. And it’s this problem that Spain’s new legislation aims to target. The algorithms that power the  gig economy – from Glovo and Stuart to UberEats and Deliveroo – can be tweaked at any moment to be more beneficial to the companies that control them.</p><p>  Glovo的算法建立了骑手的分数。为了确定得分 - 并增加它 - 公司依赖于随时运送速度，客户评级或可用性等因素，以及不与骑手共享的其他因素。这是西班牙的新立法旨在瞄准这个问题。推动Gig经济的算法 - 从Glovo和Stuart到Ubereats和Surferoo  - 可以随时调整，对控制它们的公司更有利。</p><p> “They tell you being a freelance is cool because you can decide when to work. But at the end, you realise you have to work when they ask you. At Glovo, if you don’t accept an order, you lose [points]”, says Núria Soto, who created the Spanish riders collective Riders X Derechos. Alongside lawyers collective Col·lectiu Ronda, Riders X Derechos has orchestrated several court cases in Barcelona arguing that gig economy companies rely on a system of exploitation and unfair penalties that violates workers’ basic rights – for instance by penalising workers for going on strikes, or not accepting an order. “I’ve only been scored badly twice, and I don’t know why,” explains Maracucho. “People don’t understand the implications of this for workers, but when I was scored badly I lost points and therefore working hours.”</p><p> “他们告诉你作为自由职业者很酷，因为你可以决定什么时候工作。但最后，你意识到你必须在他们问你时工作。在Glovo，如果你不接受订单，你就会失去[积分]“，他表示，创造了西班牙骑手集体骑手X Derechos的NúriaSot。除了律师集体ColiCerence ColiCerectiu Ronda，Riders X Derechos在巴塞罗那策划了几个法院案件，争论演出经济公司依赖于侵犯工人基本权利的剥削和不公平的惩罚制度 - 例如，惩罚罢工，或者不接受订单。 “我才得到两次得分，我不知道为什么，”马拉科科解释。 “人们对工人的影响不了解这一点，但是当我得分严重得分时，我丢失了积分，因此工作时间。”</p><p>  The algorithms underpinning these companies have helped their profits soar –  Glovo was born in Barcelonain 2015 and now is delivering in 20 countries, with some estimates putting its valuation at £1.2bn. But pressure from organisations such as Riders X Derechos, trade unions, and lawyers have led the Spanish government to regulate gig economy algorithms and rethink the relationship between the companies and workers.</p><p>  基础上这些公司的算法帮助他们的利润飙升 - 加沃在2015年的巴塞尔诺曼出生，现在在20个国家提供，其中一些估计将其估值达到1.2亿英镑。但是，来自骑士X Derechos，工会和律师等组织的压力导致西班牙政府规范演出经济算法，并重新思考公司和工人之间的关系。 </p><p> After almost five months of negotiations, in March 2021, the Spanish government reached an agreement with the unions and employers’ associations for the regulation of the gig economy by a royal decree law, to be approved by parliament. The decree establishes the presumption that workers are not self-employed but wage labourers. It also compels these companies to inform the legal representation of workers about the inner functioning of the algorithms that determine decisions “that may affect working conditions, and access to and maintenance of employment, including profiling”.</p><p>经过近五个月的谈判，在2021年3月，西班牙政府与议会批准的议会批准，西班牙政府达成协议。法令确定了工人不是自雇但工资劳动者的推定。它还迫使这些公司通知工人的法律代表，了解确定决定的算法的内部运作，这些算法“可能影响工作条件，并获取和维护就业，包括分析”。</p><p> When the law is approved, Spain’s decision to force digital companies to open up part of their algorithm to their workers could have an impact across the EU, which has already begun negotiations with employers to reach similar agreements.</p><p> 当法律批准时，西班牙决定强迫数字公司向其工人开放部分算法可能会对欧盟产生影响，这已经与雇主谈判达成了类似的协议。</p><p>  “Opening algorithms is above all an element of guaranteeing democratic and labour rights,” says Carlos del Barrio, secretary in Catalonia for sectoral policies and sustainability, territorial policy and social action at Comisiones Obreras (CC.OO), one of the two largest unions in the country. The law will begin to claw back rights for riders, who are subjected to intense exploitation, del Barrio argues. “Algorithms discriminate on the basis of sex and gender, along with many other factors,” he claims.</p><p>  “开放算法超出了保障民主和劳工权利的全部元素，”卡塔诺伊秘书秘书Carlos del Barrio，Catalonia部门部门政策和可持续性，在Obreras（CC.oo）的领土政策和社会行动，两个最大的工会之一在国内。 Del Barrio认为，法律将开始抓住骑手的骑手权利，潜水剥削。 “算法在性别和性别的基础上歧视许多其他因素，”他声称。</p><p>  Gig economy companies have not welcomed the agreement. After the new regulations were passed, APS, a trade group which includes Glovo, Uber Eats, Deliveroo and Stuart claimed that having to disclose their algorithms “would without doubt very negatively affect the development of the digital economy in Spain, in addition to infringing on the most basic principles of freedom of enterprise and industrial property&#34;. Neither Glovo nor Deliveroo responded to requests for comment. An Uber spokesperson says the company is “fully committed to raising the standard of work and giving independent workers more benefits while preserving flexibility and control”.</p><p>  Gig经济公司并无欢迎协议。在通过新的法规后，APS，包括Glovo，Uber Eats，DelignoO和Stuart的贸易团体声称必须披露他们的算法“毫无疑问地对西班牙数字经济的发展非常负面影响，以及侵权企业自由和工业产权自由的最基本原则。 Glovo也不差价响应评论请求。优步发言人表示，该公司“完全致力于提高工作标准，并在保持灵活性和控制的同时更具益处”。</p><p> Ulises Cortés, scientific coordinator for artificial intelligence at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center says that the internet’s exponential growth has partly been driven by the lack of strong legislation regulating its use. “No one ever thought of legislating the use of private data; therefore until now, there has been no regulation of the law for digital platforms.” While prising their algorithms open could make companies lose competitive advantage, Cortés says that the rule will finally bring some fairness to a sector that has often wielded its algorithms carelessly, on the presumption that they will never be regulated.</p><p> 巴塞罗那超级计算中心的人工智能科学协调员ulisescortés表示，互联网的指数增长部分受到缺乏强劲立法调节其使用的推动。 “没有人想到立法使用私人数据;因此，到目前为止，没有对数字平台的法律规定。“虽然珍贵算法开放可以使公司失去竞争优势，但Cortés说，这条规则最终将为一个经常挥舞其算法的行业带来一些公平，因为他们永远不会受到监管的推定。</p><p> But even that might not be enough to fix the rot at the heart of the gig economy model, which remains fundamentally stacked against the riders. Maracucho says that he, like many other migrant riders who need to earn money, is interested in being able to work as many hours as he can. He worries that if the law is approved, Glovo will hire them for fewer hours and lower wages. At the same time, Maracucho recognises that the current conditions are bad: the company pays very little – according to CC.OO, Glovo currently pays €1.60 (£1.39) per order plus mileage – lowers fees without consultation, and does not cover employee holidays. He believes that the scoring system is unfair and should be regulated.</p><p> 但即使这可能还不足以在演出经济模型的核心处固定腐烂，这仍然依然堆叠在骑手上。 Maracucho说，像许多需要赚钱的其他移民车手一样，有兴趣能够在他能够尽可能多的时间工作。他担心，如果法律获得批准，格洛沃将雇用他们的小时数和较低的工资。与此同时，Maracucho认识到当前条件不好：公司支付很少 - 根据CC.OO，Glovo目前每令每次订单支付1.60欧元（1.39英镑）加上里程 - 降低费用，没有咨询，不包括员工假期。他认为得分制度是不公平的，应该受到监管。</p><p> Unions and lawyers point out that the decree will not force companies to hire their workers – it will just assume they should do it. But even taking for granted that companies will hire their workers, the new law will leave thousands of irregular workers out of the system. These are the workers who have fuelled the growth of the platforms, and that have been exploited by  ruthless gangmasters and occasional profiteers hovering on the margins of the gig economy. According to Carlos del Barrio, to rent accounts – as Maracucho used to do – is very common in Spain. In Catalonia alone, there are approximately five riders for each license. “There are people who make money at the expense of others suffering the most absolute precarity, taking orders that no one wants to take, schedules that no one wants to work”, del Barrio says.</p><p> 联合国和律师指出，该法令不会强迫公司雇用工人 - 它将只是假设他们应该这样做。但即使是理所当然的公司将雇用工人，新法律将使数千名不规则工人从系统中留出。这些是促进了平台增长的工人，这是由无情的钢管和偶尔悬停在演出经济的边缘的恐怖主义者。根据Carlos del Barrio的说法，租赁账户 - 正如Maracucho过去所做的那样 - 在西班牙非常普遍。仅在加泰罗尼亚，每次许可都有大约五名车手。 “有些人以遭受最绝对的强制性的牺牲品为代价赚钱，只要没有人想要采取的订单，没有人想工作的时间”，德尔巴罗奥尔说。 </p><p>  Maracucho is clear: “I doubt that Spaniards will pick up a bicycle and start delivering. The platforms work thanks to the people who work irregularly,” he says. “What are they going to do now with all the riders who don’t have papers, who have basically sustained the platforms and raised them up?”</p><p>马拉科科很清楚：“我怀疑西班牙人将拿起自行车并开始交付。他说，平台归功于不规则工作的人，“他说。 “他们现在与没有论文的所有骑手一起做了什么，他们基本上持续了平台并提出了它们？”</p><p>  Digital Society is a digital magazine exploring how technology is changing society.
