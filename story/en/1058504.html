It’s been few weeks since the last issue, and that’s because I’ve been quite busy. These issues are a blast to write, but they take quite some time.</p><p>读者！自上次问题以来已经几周，这是因为我一直很忙。这些问题是一种爆炸​​，但他们需要一段时间。</p><p> Anyways, I hope you enjoy, and feel free email or tweet at me if you have any questions!</p><p> 无论如何，如果您有任何疑问，我希望您能享受，并为我感到免费电子邮件或推文！</p><p>  As someone who spends a lot of time in front of a screen, I’m very concious of the effects it has on my health. One of the biggest consequences is to my eyes. While in front of a screen, I blink less frequently, and my eyes dry out faster.</p><p>  作为在屏幕前花很多时间的人，我对我健康的影响非常有意。最大的后果是我的眼睛。而在屏幕前面，我频繁眨眼，我的眼睛变得更快。</p><p> For a long time, I’ve known about the  20-20-20 Rule, which is a tip many eye doctors recommend to patients. Every 20 minutes you spend in front of a screen, look away for 20 seconds, at something 20 feet away. It gets your eyes to refocus, exercises their muscles, and breaks your stare.</p><p> 很长一段时间，我已经知道了20-20-20个规则，这是一个提示患者的尖端。每隔20分钟你花在屏幕前，看起来有20秒，在20英尺远的东西。它让你的眼睛重新聚焦，锻炼他们的肌肉，然后打破你的凝视。</p><p> Actually following that advice is not easy. Given the amount of time we spend in front of screens, keeping track of 20 minute intervals can become very tedious. Which makes it easy for many people to acknowledge the advice, but not follow it.</p><p> 实际上，建议并不容易。鉴于我们在屏幕前花费的时间，跟踪20分钟的间隔会变得非常繁琐。这使得很多人都让很容易承认建议，但不遵循它。</p><p> In January, I saw a tweet from Alex, co-founder of Gikken, which mentioned they were shutting down two of their apps in order to focus their efforts on a flagship product. As a small company, this is often a practical and smart decision. One of the apps was  Breaks For Eyes, a Mac menu bar app that reminds you to take a break and look away, every 20 minutes.</p><p> 1月，我看到了Gikken联合创始人的亚历克斯的推文，提到他们正在关闭他们的两个应用程序，以便将他们的努力集中在旗舰产品上。作为一家小公司，这往往是一个实用而聪明的决定。其中一个应用程序是休息的眼睛，一个MAC菜单栏应用程序，让您提醒您休息一下，每20分钟休息一下。</p><p>  I&#39;m crushed to announce that we&#39;ll be shutting down Reji and Breaks for Eyes shortly.   Reji: 31/03 BFE: 19/02  Probably, there&#39;ll be a developer interested in acquiring either of them &amp; keeping alive just like we did with @ .  RTs appreciated 🔁   https://t.co/z1A0ak0Wle</p><p>  我咳嗽宣布我们＆＃39;我很快就会关闭Reji并休息睁眼。 reji：31/03 bfe：19/02可能，有一个有兴趣收购其中任何一个的开发人员＆amp;就像我们用@一样活着保持活力。 RTS赞赏🔁https://t.co/z1a0ak0wle </p><p>  When he posted the tweet, Alex mentioned his hopes for a new developer to take over the project. I’d been looking for an app to acquire for some time, but my criteria yielded few opportunities. This met all of them.</p><p>当他发布推文时，亚历克斯提到了他对新开发人员接管该项目的希望。我一直在寻找一个应用程序一段时间，但我的标准产生了很少的机会。这满足了所有人。</p><p>  In college, I started building a similar app with a friend. We called it  Avert! but when an Apple notifications bug left my computer in a state of constant notifications (every 10 seconds), I shifted my attention elsewhere.</p><p>  在大学里，我开始与朋友建立类似的应用程序。我们打电话给它！但是当Apple Notifications Bug以持续通知状态留下我的计算机时（每10秒钟），我将注意力转移到其他地方。</p><p> My mom is an Optician and often reminding me to take care of my eyes.</p><p> 我妈妈是一个配镜师，经常提醒我照顾我的眼睛。</p><p> I wear blue-light blocking glasses while in front of a computer screen. Their effectiveness is a controversial topic, but I find them helpful.</p><p> 在电脑屏幕前，我戴上蓝光阻挡眼镜。他们的有效性是一个有争议的话题，但我发现它们有用。</p><p>  Breaks For Eyes is a super simple app with a lot of competitors, but it just does the job better. It has hundreds of five star reviews, and over several updates, the Gikken team had worked out many of the problems that led to poor reviews.</p><p>  眼睛的休息是一个超级简单的应用程序，具有很多竞争对手，但它只是更好的工作。它有数百星级的评论，并在几个更新的更新中，Gikken团队致力于许多导致差别评论的问题。</p><p> The competition signals there’s a strong demand for this sort of app, so I wouldn’t be spending time carving out an audience.</p><p> 竞争信号对这种应用程序有很大的需求，所以我不会花时间雕刻出观众。</p><p>  Immediately I saw the ways in which I could make the app better and more appealling. I saw an opportunity to use BFE as an experiment to flex my different creative muscles while also challenging my entrepreneurial instincts.</p><p>  我立即看到了我可以使应用程序更好，更具吸引力的方式。我看到有机会使用BFE作为一种实验来弯曲我不同的创意肌肉，同时也挑战了我的创业本能。 </p><p> I’m far more confident in my skills and vision than my investing knowledge. I’m drawn towards investments where I can control the return I see, through the work I put into it. In real estate, this is called Value-Add investing.</p><p>我对我的技能和愿景感到非常自信，而不是我的投资知识。我正在投资我可以控制我看到的回报，通过我投入的工作。在房地产中，这被称为价值加入投资。</p><p>    I reached out to Alex, one of the co-founders of Gikken. I had never made an offer on app before, but I did a couple of things that I think helped everything go smoothly.</p><p>    我伸出了亚历克斯，是Gikken的联合创始人之一。我以前从未在应用程序上发出过报价，但我做了几件事，我认为帮助一切顺利。</p><p> I highlighted what I thought was great about the app, truthfully. No creator wants to hand over their work to someone who someone who doesn’t see the effort that was put into it.</p><p> 我突出了我认为这是对这个应用程序的想法，如实。没有创造者想把他们的工作交给那些没有看到努力的人的人。</p><p> I made it clear I was not interested in wasting his time. Time prioritization was the reason BFE was being sold, and I wanted to make it obvious that I understood that. Selling a product/company can be a stressful experience, but I wanted to make this as simple as possible.</p><p> 我明确了我对浪费他的时间并不感兴趣。时间优先考虑是BFE被销售的原因，我想明白我明白。销售产品/公司可能是一种压力的体验，但我想尽可能简单。</p><p> If this does sounds good, I’m ready to get things moving quickly, and take up as little of your time as possible, so you can get back to focusing on your business ASAP.</p><p> 如果这听起来很好，我已经准备好让事情快速移动，并尽可能少的时间占用，所以你可以尽快回到你的业务。</p><p>  I’ve had questions from readers of the newsletter about what the actual transaction process looks like. For this one, it was extremely simple and true to my word.</p><p>  我对时事通讯的读者讨论了实际的交易过程的疑问。对于这个，它非常简单，是我的话。</p><p> We agreed on a price and contents to be transferred: the app, the domain and website contents, the Medium blog ownership, the GitHub repo.</p><p> 我们同意转让的价格和内容：应用程序，域名和网站内容，中博所有权，Github Repo。 </p><p> We agreed to use Escrow.com. I had used them once before when I sold some apps in high school, and remembered a pain free experience. This time around, it was slow. I kept pinging Escrow to get updates, and after 5-6 days, when they finally were ready to finish processing the transaction, they were unwilling to deposit the funds in the way Alex wanted.</p><p>我们同意使用escrow.com。我在高中销售了一些应用程序之前，我曾经用过它们一次，并记住了止痛体验。这次，它很慢。我一直竞争托管获得更新，在5-6天后，当他们终于准备完成交易时，他们不愿以亚历克斯想要的方式存入资金。</p><p> At this point it was clear that both parties trusted each other. I ended up convincing Escrow to reverse the transaction (which they claim they won’t do) and I just transferred the funds over PayPal. At this point, Alex had already transferred almost everything over to me. It was a pretty casual transaction, and I think that’s the way to do it for small apps. If I were to spend too much time on the due diligence and the transaction for a very small deal, I don’t think it’d be worth it, and for a seller whose motivations are to prioritize their time, it definitely wouldn’t be worth it. If I didn’t trust the person enough to do it this way, I probably just wouldn’t do it.</p><p> 此时显然，双方都相互信任。我最终劝告托管扭转交易（他们声称他们不会做的），我刚把资金转移超过PayPal。此时，亚历克斯几乎已经转移到我身上。这是一个非常休闲的交易，我认为这是为小型应用程序做到这一点的方式。如果我要在尽职调查和交易中花费太多时间，我认为这不值得，并且对于卖方的动机是优先考虑他们的时间，绝对不会值得。如果我不相信足够的人这样做，我可能只是不会这样做。</p><p> Ok so now I have the app, my bank account is lesser by a $3k, and I’m a happy camper. What do I do now?</p><p> 好的，所以现在我有这个应用程序，我的银行账户较小，3万美元，我是一个快乐的露营者。现在我该怎么做？</p><p>  Now that I owned the domain name breaksforeyes.app, the first thing I did was make sure that it was up and running with my host. There are several backlinks across the web that lead to it, and there’s no way I was going to waste them. I spent half a day updating it and making it a bit more compelling for someone interested. At this point I was unsure if I would rename the app or do a more extensive website redesign, but in hindsight this minor design update was still time well spent, because I plan on keeping breaksforeyes.app running separately from tryintermission.com.</p><p>  既然我拥有域名突破，我所做的第一件事就是确保它已经上升了并与我的主机一起运行。网上有几个反向链接导致它，我无法浪费它们。我花了半天更新它并让人对感兴趣的人更引人注目。在这一点上，我不确定我是否会重命名应用程序或做一个更广泛的网站重新设计，但在后似智事的这个小型设计更新仍然花了很好的花费，因为我计划将Breaksforeyes.app与TryIntermission.com分开运行。</p><p>      The second thing I did was set up a Twitter account. There was no social presence for BFE, and since I run multiple Twitter accounts already, creating one for BFE was low hanging fruit. I snagged @BreaksForEyes, though it’s now @TryIntermission.</p><p>      我确实的第二件事是建立了一个推特账户。 BFE没有社交业务，因为我已经运行了多个Twitter帐户，为BFE创建一个是低悬垂的水果。我抓住了@breaksforeyes，虽然现在是@tryintermission。</p><p> The third thing I did was start a list on my phone. Every time I had an idea, or receieved a suggestion from a customer, I wrote it down. This was everything from feature ideas to name ideas to possible updated App Store keywords. It was not ranked or prioritized, just a dumping ground.</p><p> 我所做的第三件事是在手机上开始列表。每次我有一个想法，或者从客户那里得到建议时，我会写下。这是来自特色想法的一切，以便将想法命名为可能更新的应用商店关键字。它没有排名或优先考虑，只是倾销。</p><p>  It’s already a successful app for what it does. It has the highest rating with more reviews than any competitor, and it does its job really well. Customers generally love it, so why change anything?</p><p>  它已经是它的成功应用程序。它具有最高评分，比任何竞争对手更多的评论，它的工作确实很好。客户一般喜欢它，为什么改变任何东西？ </p><p> A couple of the competitors are cross-platform. They have a Mac app and an iOS app. I thought about making some sort of cross platform syncing feature for BFE, but I couldn’t justify the time investment to do that, and I don’t think I’d even want to use that, personally.</p><p>几个竞争对手是跨平台。他们有一个Mac应用程序和iOS应用程序。我考虑为BFE制作某种交叉平台同步功能，但我无法证明时间投资做出依据，而且我认为我甚至不想就是用它。</p><p> I was still intrigued by the benefit of having a precense on the iOS app store. Because the Mac App Store is a smaller market, it might be effective to draw in an untapped iOS audience.</p><p> 我仍然在IOS App Store上有一种预期的好处感兴趣。由于Mac App Store是一个较小的市场，因此绘制未开发的iOS受众可能是有效的。</p><p> Since my mom is an optician, she mentioned putting a sign/flyer up in the store where she works. I’m not aware of any competitors who use eye doctors as a distribution channel, but it’s something I’m planning to try. From here I generated a bunch of ideas, were I to go down this path. All were put onto the list I created.</p><p> 自从我的妈妈是配镜师以来，她提到把一个标志/传单放在她工作的商店里。我不知道任何使用眼科医生作为分销渠道的竞争对手，但这是我打算尝试的东西。从这里我产生了一堆想法，我要走下这条路。所有人都被放在我创建的列表上。</p><p> I considered what could be done to the monetization strategy. Customers love this app, and it’s just $5. I brainstormed what I could offer customers if I were to monetize BFE with a subscription. I decided against this.</p><p> 我认为可以对货币化战略进行什么。客户喜欢这个应用程序，这只是5美元。如果我将BFE通过订阅将BFE货币化，我会集思广益。我决定反对这一点。</p><p> Ok. Clearly I’m comfortable being the  idea guy, but what did I  actually do?</p><p> 好的。显然，我很舒服是这个想法，但我实际做了什么？</p><p> I decided to start working on an iOS app. The Mac app was stable and not in dire need of improvement. Plus, I’ve been really enjoying building things with SwiftUI. Every day for about a week and half, I’d wake up early and spend the first half of my day on it. I called it Breaks. And then I cut myself off. I returned my full focus to another project, and BFE went back on the shelf.</p><p> 我决定开始在iOS应用程序上工作。 Mac应用程序稳定，不需要改进需求。此外，我一直享受与Swifui的建筑物。每天大约一周一半，我会早起，花在我上一天的上半场。我打电话给它。然后我把自己剪掉了。我把我的全部焦点归还给另一个项目，BFE回到了货架上。</p><p>    Several weeks later, I returned to the project. I designed a new landing page in Figma. I decided on the name Intermission, designed an icon, and updated the iOS app to match the personality of the name. Again, I cut myself off.</p><p>    几周后，我回到了这个项目。我设计了一个图为图的新着陆页。我决定了名称中断，设计了一个图标，并更新了iOS应用程序以匹配名称的个性。再次，我削减了自己。 </p><p>        The week of March 25th, I made the decision to work on an update to the Mac app. I realized that handling an update of the Mac app and a brand new iOS app for the same product at the same time wasn’t going to be the right approach. It would be smarter to first do the thing that had the potential to have the bigger impact on sales. That was the Mac app. There was another reason too: I came across an exact clone of BFE, and it really motivated me to start differentiating.</p><p>3月25日的一周，我决定在Mac应用程序上工作。我意识到，同时处理同一产品的Mac应用程序和全新的iOS应用程序不会是正确的方法。首先做有可能对销售产生更大影响的事情是更聪明的。那是Mac应用程序。还有另一个原因：我遇到了一个精确的BFE克隆，它真的有动力开始差异化。</p><p> I spent 3-4 days jumping into the Breaks For Eyes code for the first time and trimming it down a bit. It was very well documented, but I no longer needed any code for licensing/payments handled outside of the App Store. I made the decision to simplify everything and only use the App Store for distribution. I went through my big list of ideas and picked out the ones that would improve everyone’s experience, and would demonstrate the added value of Intermission over a competitor. I worked on those. I tested it out for a few days, and gave it to my girlfriend to help me test as well.</p><p> 我花了3-4天的时间跳进了眼睛代码的休息时间，第一次修剪它一点。它记录得很好，但我不再需要在App Store之外处理的许可/付款代码。我决定简化一切，只使用App Store进行分发。我经历了我的大思想名单，并挑选出来会提高每个人的经历，并将展示竞争对手的中场间歇性的附加值。我工作了。我在几天内测试了它，给了我女朋友帮我测试。</p><p> I honestly thought at this point I would be ready to submit it. I even tweeted about it:</p><p> 我真的想到了我准备提交它。我甚至推断了它：</p><p>  Yesterday I worked on the next version of @ . Today I worked on localization, and after a few days of testing to make sure it&#39;s working smoothly, I&#39;ll submit the update to Apple! Here&#39;s a sneak peek...  https://t.co/Cbq9cU0CaE</p><p>  昨天我在下一个版本的@。今天我在本地化上工作，经过几天的测试，确保它顺利地工作，我将更新＆＃39; ll向Apple提交更新！这里＆＃39; s潜行偷看... https://t.co/cbq9cu0cae</p><p>  Haha, I was not done yet. Last week I bought the domain tryintermission.com and turned the landing page design into HTML+CSS. I figured, for spending one or two more days on the Mac app, I could add some more standout improvements. It knew was going to be worth my time, and it was.</p><p>  哈哈，我还没有完成。上周我购买了域制tryIntermission.com并将着陆页设计转换为HTML + CSS。我想，在Mac应用程序上花一两个天，我可以增加一些更突出的改进。它知道是值得我的时间，而且它是。</p><p>    As of yesterday, Intermission is live on the Mac App Store. That was a bit of ramble, so let me share what I improved:</p><p>    截至昨天，间歇在Mac App Store上生活。这是一点漫步，所以让我分享我改进的东西：</p><p>  … with new icons, screenshots, and copy. The existing icon was polished but somewhat intimidating, and the app store screenshots were bright and attractive, but the copy didn’t differentiate the app as well as it could have.</p><p>  ...与新图标，屏幕截图和复制。现有的图标是抛光但有点令人恐惧，而App Store屏幕截图是明亮和有吸引力的，但副本没有区分应用程序。 </p><p>      In a competitive landscape, branding is important, so I took the opportunity to insert the Intermission  theme where I could without taking away from the core experience. The sounds are called “chimes” and the icon is a theater curtain. The headline on the landing page is  “Take Direction Over Your Screen Time”. It’s not much, but the goal is to make it feel more than just an app, and give it some personality.</p><p>在竞争的景观中，品牌是重要的，所以我借此机会在我可以在不带走核心经验的情况下插入中场主题。声音被称为“chimes”，图标是剧院窗帘。登陆页面上的标题是“通过屏幕时的方向”。这并不多，但目标是让它感觉不仅仅是一个应用程序，并给予它一些个性。</p><p>  The biggest advantage competitors had over Breaks For Eyes is customization. Time Out, the only direct competitor that sees more downloads, is extremely customizable to the point that I think it’s overwhelming for most people. A lot of the negative reviews for BFE, though few in number, strike at the point that BFE did not allow you to stray from the 20-20-20 rule. I wanted to add features that add to the value without unnecesarrily complicating the user experience, so I added the following:</p><p>  最大的优势竞争对手已经过度休息是定制的。超时，看到更多下载的唯一直接竞争对手是非常可定制的，即我认为对大多数人来说是压倒性的。对BFE的很多负面评论，虽然数量很少，但BFE不允许您从20-20-20规则中偏离的那一点。我想添加添加到值的功能，而无需不必要地复杂化用户体验，因此我添加了以下内容：</p><p>   BFE was already localized to 5 different languages. I decided to add another: Hindi. India was the region with the largest number of downloads that the app had not yet been localized for. If there’s anywhere I messed up in this process, it was localization. I had never done it before, and it’s the only thing I would do differently if I had the chance. I ended up re-translating all of the copy across the entire app, for all localizations. I expect future updates will be addressing improvements here, but since a huge majority of customers are using the English version, I decided to release as is rather than spending more time perfecting the translations.</p><p>   BFE已经本地化为5种不同的语言。我决定添加另一个：印地。印度是该应用程序尚未本地化的下载最多的地区。如果在这个过程中有任何地方搞砸了，那就是本地化。我以前从未这样做过，如果我有机会，这是我唯一会做出不同的事情。我最终重新翻译了整个应用程序的所有副本，适用于所有本地化。我期望未来的更新将在此处解决改进，但由于大多数客户使用英文版，我决定发布，而不是花更多的时间完善翻译。</p><p>  The new landing page describes Intermission as more than just an app, which I think will help if in the future I pitch it to doctors and business owners. The old landing page will continue to draw in existing traffic from backlinks.</p><p>  新的着陆页描述了频道，只要一个应用程序，我认为将来会帮助我将其投放给医生和企业主。旧的着陆页将继续从反向链接中汲取现有流量。</p><p>  I made some updates to the App Store keywords, and I hope they’ll yield some more traffic.</p><p>  我对App Store关键字进行了一些更新，我希望他们会产生更多的流量。</p><p>  It’s not really an improvement for the customer, but I want to test a higher price and gauge the reaction. It’s been at $4.99 but I have it set to change to $7.99 shortly.</p><p>  对客户来说并不是一种改进，但我想测试更高的价格并衡量反应。它的价格为4.99美元，但我很快就会更改为7.99美元。</p><p>   The iOS app. It’s very close to ready, but I’m just not prioritizing it right now.</p><p>   iOS应用程序。它是非常接近的准备，但我现在只是没有优先考虑它。 </p><p> I tried having Intermission understand when the customer has Do Not Disturb turned on, but Apple does not share this information with Developers.</p><p>当客户没有打扰时，我尝试了休息了解，但Apple不会与开发人员分享此信息。</p><p> I tried having Intermission automatically pause audio/video when a break begins, but again, Apple does not share with Developers if there is audio/video playing from another app.</p><p> 我尝试在休息开始时自动暂停音频/视频，但如果有来自另一个应用程序的音频/视频播放，Apple再次与开发人员分享。</p><p> I had fun working on this and I’m glad I purchased the app. When I did, I thought it was a good deal, and in hindsight it was a great deal. At the time of the sale, I was concerned about recent sales being unsustainable due to a holiday bump, but they’ve held up and even grown. In February, proceeds were $325, and in March they were $433. April looked to be on track with February, but fingers crossed the update and pricing change work in my favor.</p><p> 我很开心地努力，我很高兴我购买了这个应用程序。当我这样做时，我认为这是一个很好的交易，而在后智事是这是一个很好的交易。在销售时，我担心近期销售因假期凹凸而不可持续，但他们仍然长大。 2月份，收益为325美元，三月在3月份为433美元。 4月份在2月份看着轨道，但手指越过了我倾向的更新和定价改变工作。</p><p> Barring any breaking issues that appear, I’m going to let it sit for a bit. In a month or two, I’ll have some perspective on how existing customers responded to the improvements I’ve made, and I can evaluate how the App Store profile changes I made affect downloads and sales.</p><p> 禁止出现的任何破坏问题，我将让它坐一下。在一个月或两个月内，我会有一些视角，即现有的客户如何回复我所做的改进，我可以评估应用程序商店配置文件如何更改我对下载和销售进行影响。</p><p> Other than that, I’ll let the response to my improvements dictate how much more time I put into Intermission. I will say that I’m excited to have this acquisition &amp; improvement completed so I have the bandwidth to take on another of a similar size. I’m always on the lookout…</p><p> 除此之外，我会让我的改进的回应决定了我进入间歇的时间。我会说我很高兴有这个收购和amp;改进完成，因此我有带宽占据另一个相似大小的带宽。我总是在寻找......</p><p>      Hello Readers, thanks for tuning into Apple Turnover. Are you an iOS/Mac app developer or entrepreneur interested in acquiring apps? Each issue, I&#39;ll be reviewing a selection of app investment opportunities sourced from public marketplaces, and private conversations. I won&#39;t just be analyzing financials.
