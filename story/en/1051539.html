The nuts and bolts, the nitty-gritty details.</p><p> 理论很棒，我喜欢一个很好的社区框架，但有时你只想听到人们所做的内容。螺母和螺栓，细节细节。</p><p> So in the spirit of learning in public, here&#39;s how we bootstrapped our initial community.</p><p> 所以从公共场合学习的精神，这里我们如何引导我们的初始社区。</p><p> It ain’t perfect, but it’s something, and I hope the specific tactics and details will help others get their community flywheel spinning.</p><p> 它不是完美的，但这是某种东西，我希望具体的策略和细节能够帮助别人得到他们的社区飞轮旋转。</p><p>  Our community started off in a Slack workspace. Today  we&#39;re on Discord, but using Slack in the early days meant we could get going super quick, without much thought to server config and other complexities.</p><p>  我们的社区开始在一个松弛的工作空间中。今天我们＆＃39;在不和谐，但在早期使用松弛意味着我们可以超级快速，没有太多想法到服务器配置和其他复杂性。</p><p> At the time, we felt like we were solving a million problems at once, since we were building both community and  product, and didn’t feel like we had the headspace to also pioneer a nascent community platform.</p><p> 当时，我们觉得我们立即解决了一百万个问题，因为我们正在建立社区和产品，并且没有觉得我们有前星空间也能够开拓一个新生的社区平台。</p><p> Slack isn’t perfect, but it’s definitely well understood and simple to spin-up. It reduced the cognitive barrier to us in terms of setup, but also was an easy ask for early members, all of whom already had Slack open and running all day.</p><p> 懈怠并不完美，但它绝对很好地理解和旋转简单。它在设置方面减少了对我们的认知障碍，但也很容易提出早期成员，所有这些都已经松懈地开放并整天运行。 </p><p>   Starting on Slack, we had only 2 channels at first: #general and #feedback. Feedback was mostly bug reports and feature requests, whereas general was, well, general conversation.</p><p>从松弛开始，我们起初只有2个频道：#general和#feedback。反馈大多数是错误报告和功能请求，而一般是，普通话。</p><p> At the start, having just two channels was fantastic. First, it reduced the community ghost town effect by concentrating all activity into those two places.</p><p> 在开始时，只有两个频道很棒。首先，它通过将所有活动集中到这两个地方来减少社区鬼城效应。</p><p> Density is crucial in the early stage of building a community, so I think it’s important to reduce the surface area for interactions on whatever platform you choose.</p><p> 密度在建立社区的早期阶段至关重要，因此我认为减少您选择的任何平台的互动的表面积很重要。</p><p> Second, it meant Team Orbit only had two channels to pay attention to. We were a three-person team all of 2020, so it seemed important to limit the number of things to monitor and engage with.</p><p> 其次，它意味着团队轨道只有两个渠道要注意。我们是2020年的三人团队，因此似乎很重要，以限制要监控和聘用的事物数量。</p><p> I get it — It’s tempting to create lots of fun channels in a new Slack or Discord, but in the early stages, density is destiny, so work to concentrate your conversations.</p><p> 我得到它 - 在一个新的休闲或不和谐中创造大量有趣的频道，但在早期阶段，密度是命运，所以努力集中谈话。</p><p> Today, though, our  Slack Integration and  Slack App make it much easier to engage and measure growth of Slack communities, and I wish we&#39;d had them when we were first getting started.</p><p> 然而，今天，我们的Slack集成和Slack应用程序使得闲置社区的增长更容易，并且我希望我们有时＆＃39;当我们第一次入门时有它们。</p><p>  Not only were we getting our community off the ground — we were building the very first version of the Orbit product at the same time, and we didn’t have much to show for either, except for a handful of engaged early adopters.</p><p>  我们不仅是让我们的社区脱离地面 - 我们正在同时建造一流的轨道产品，除了少数从事早期采用者外，我们没有太多展示。 </p><p> Our early community members were folks who were excited about the  Orbit Model, interested in better tooling for DevRel and community, and were willing to try almost anything to make them more effective at delivering great experiences to their community members.</p><p>我们的早期社区成员是对轨道模型感到兴奋的人，对德国和社区的更好的工具感兴趣，并且愿意尝试几乎任何东西让他们更有效地为社区成员提供了极大的经验。</p><p> Our community members were — and still are — some of the best minds in DevRel and community, and we wanted to demonstrate how seriously we took their input and feedback.</p><p> 我们的社区成员仍然是 - 德国和社区中的一些最佳思想，我们想展示我们对投入和反馈的疑虑。</p><p> For most of 2020, Josh, Nicolas, and I were active in Slack pretty much every day, responding to every single product-related question or concern.</p><p> 对于2020年的大部分时间，Josh，Nicolas，我每天都在懈怠，回应每个与产品相关的问题或疑虑。</p><p> We got in the habit of shipping feature requests and bug fixes quickly — often the very same day.</p><p> 我们养成了运输功能请求和错误修复的习惯 - 通常是一天。</p><p> This delivery cadence helped us build credibility with the community and confidence that we may indeed be able to deliver on all the concepts and wireframes we were sharing.</p><p> 这种送货节点帮助我们与社区建立了可信度，并确实能够提供我们分享的所有概念和线框的信誉。</p><p> Not only were these conversations pivotal in the development of the product,  our quick turnaround on requests incentivized folks to share their ideas or challenges as well, knowing that the core team would quickly respond and address their situation.</p><p> 这些谈话不仅在产品的发展中关挥这些谈话，我们的快速转变就要求激励人们分享他们的想法或挑战，因为知道核心团队会很快回应并解决他们的情况。</p><p> The frequency of conversations, in turn, lowered the barrier of entry for new community members, and generally made things feel vibrant and active, all of which are encouraging outcomes for a new community.</p><p> 反过来，谈话的频率降低了新社区成员的进入障碍，并且通常让事情感到充满活力和活跃，所有这些都是鼓励新社区的结果。 </p><p> We created a virtuous cycle, in which a community member&#39;s feedback led to a response from our team plus a fast fix for their problem, which led to more confidence from our community, leading to more conversations in Slack from existing and new members and more people sharing ideas and feedback.</p><p>我们创建了一个良性循环，其中社区成员＆＃39;■反馈导致我们团队加上他们的问题的快速修复，这导致了我们社区的更多信心，导致来自现有和新的松弛成员和更多人分享想法和反馈。</p><p>  After a few months of consistent shipping, we sensed a transition in vibe from casual conversations and higher-level “what if” discussions about what Orbit  could do in theory, to how folks were using Orbit daily in practice.</p><p>  经过几个月的持续发货，我们感受到氛围从随意对话和更高级别的“如果”讨论关于在理论上可以做的轨道的讨论，如何在实践中使用轨道。</p><p>  You can actually see the increase in members later in 2020 as both the community and our product picked up velocity:</p><p>  您实际上可以看到2020年后的成员增加，因为社区和我们的产品拾取了速度：</p><p>  If you’re building a community around a product, a casual vibe is fine for a while, and it’s good to lean into general excitement about the early stages of a product and idea. But it’s essential to build on the momentum and to sustain it over time.</p><p>  如果您正在围绕产品构建社区，休闲氛围有一段时间内容很好，并且倾向于对产品和想法的早期阶段的普遍兴奋是好的。但是，建立势头并随着时间的推移维持它至关重要。</p><p> Not only will the frequent community input influence your product roadmap, but the conversations about your product can serve as the seed for building an active community.</p><p> 频繁的社区投入不仅会影响您的产品路线图，而且有关您产品的对话可以作为构建积极社区的种子。</p><p> If you can work with your early adopters to define and solve problems together, you can kickstart the conversation and begin transforming your audience into a community. If you’re doing things right, that’ll happen naturally.</p><p> 如果您可以使用早期的采用者来定义和解决问题，您可以在一起进行谈话并开始将观众转换为社区。如果你正在做对，那就是自然发生的。</p><p>  As users started building stuff on top of our  API and with our  Zapier app, we created a show-and-tell channel to share and discuss all the cool stuff they were making. This gave members a chance to talk to each other and share ideas.</p><p>  随着用户在API顶部和Zapier应用程序的顶部建立建筑物，我们创建了一个展示和告诉频道来分享和讨论他们所做的所有酷炫的东西。这让议员有机会互相交谈并分享想法。 </p><p> Nico shared zaps he&#39;d built,  David shared his node-red flows, and  Tanay shipped a  node for Orbit on n8n, then wrote  this amazing article about community metrics.</p><p>Nico共享zaps zaps he＆＃39; d构建的，大卫共享他的节点红色流，而Tanay在N8N上发布了一个节点，然后写了这个关于社区度量的神奇文章。</p><p> But we didn’t create the channel and then just cross our fingers and hope cool stuff would happen. Instead, we coupled organic interest with the intentional kickstarting of activity.</p><p> 但我们没有创造频道，然后只是穿过手指，希望很酷的事情会发生。相反，我们将有机兴趣耦合，故意踢活活动。</p><p> Here’s what I mean: before we created the channel, folks would share their creations with me directly via DM. That was amazing, but this approach didn’t help others in the community, since the conversation was 1:1 in private.</p><p> 这就是我的意思：在我们创建频道之前，人们将通过DM直接与我分享他们的创作。这是惊人的，但这种方法没有帮助社区中的其他人，因为谈话是私密的1：1。</p><p>   We didn’t try to force the community’s hand. In other words, the official #show-and-tell channel was built on organic momentum. By the time we made the channel, we knew there was interest in discussing and sharing custom integrations and workflows.</p><p>   我们没有试图强迫社区的手。换句话说，官方＃展示和告诉频道建立在有机势头上。当我们制作频道时，我们知道有兴趣讨论和共享自定义集成和工作流程。</p><p> But we didn’t leave it all to chance. In addition to leaning into the momentum, we also jump-started the conversation by posting the very first set of guides for using  Orbit&#39;s Zapier app to connect to things like Eventbrite and Slack (this was well before the release of our  official Slack Integration).</p><p> 但我们没有把它全部留给机会。除了倾向于势头之外，我们还通过发布第一套使用轨道和＃39; Zapier应用程序来连接谈话来跳跃对话，以连接到比赛遗嘱和休闲（这在官方发布之前）松弛集成）。</p><p>  In any early-stage community, it’s incumbent on the organizers to help get the conversation going, in the same way a dinner party host makes introductions and suggests topics that’ll be interesting to the group.</p><p>  在任何早期阶段的社区中，组织者有责任帮助谈话会进行谈话，同样地是一位晚宴主持人提出介绍，并提出对本集团有趣的主题。</p><p> In this case, we created the new space based on existing interest and momentum, invited the community in, then set the performative example for the new channel.</p><p> 在这种情况下，我们根据现有的兴趣和势头创建了新的空间，邀请社区进入，然后设置新频道的执行示例。 </p><p> Overall, if your community is interested in leveling-up their skills and expertise around a product, show-and-tell channels are a great way to facilitate and encourage many-to-many conversations, as members share ideas and workflows with one another.</p><p>总的来说，如果您的社区有兴趣调整产品的技能和专业知识，则显示和告诉渠道是促进和鼓励多对多对话的好方法，因为成员共享彼此共享想法和工作流程。</p><p>  By the time we hit ~100 members in Slack, channels like #random and #book-club started to appear organically, created by the members. Folks started discussing Nadia Eghbal’s fantastic book,   Working in Public, as well as sharing tweets and memes and various esoteric items with each other, such as the fact that  K-pop group LOOΠΔ calls their fans “Orbits.”</p><p>  当我们在松弛中达到〜100成员时，像#Random和#book-club这样的频道开始有机地呈现出来的成员。人们开始讨论Nadia Eghbal的奇妙的书，在公共场所工作，以及共享推文和模因和各种宇宙物品，例如K-Pop GroupLoyπδ调用他们的粉丝“轨道”。</p><p> To us, these new conversations felt like a new stage of the Orbit community, and marked a key shift from one-to-many conversations to many-to-many.  Our audience was really starting to become a community.</p><p> 对我们来说，这些新的对话感觉像轨道社区的一个新阶段，并标志着一对多对话到多对多的关键转变。我们的观众真的开始成为一个社区。</p><p> Here you can see the growth in activity in channels over 2020, including the show-and-tell channel, random, and book club, as well as a pickup in the new #integration-slack channel later in the year, where we worked with a subset of the community on developing that part of the product.</p><p> 在这里，您可以看到2020多个渠道的活动增长，包括展示和告诉渠道，随机和书籍俱乐部，以及在年后的新的＃Integration-Slack频道中的提货，我们与之合作社区的一部分是开发产品的那部分。</p><p>   So many early-stage community leaders ask me about this tipping point. Conversations in the early days of product- or company-centric communities are inevitably characterized by community members asking the founders about the product.</p><p>   这么多早期的社区领导者问我这一举报点。在产品 - 或以公司为中心的社区的早期对话不可避免地是以社区成员询问创始人对该产品的特征。</p><p> But thriving communities somehow transition to more a diversified cadence involving lots of folks across the community. So how can you facilitate this transition?</p><p> 但蓬勃发展的社区以某种方式过渡到更多样化的节奏，涉及整个社区中的大量人士。那么你如何促进这种过渡？</p><p> In my experience,  creating a sense of psychological safety is key to facilitating many-to-many conversations.</p><p> 在我的经验中，创造了一种心理安全感，是促进多对多对话的关键。 </p><p> One great way to do that is to help members feel like they know who’s on the other side of those usernames in Slack, and that those people are generally nice.</p><p>这样做的一个好方法是帮助成员觉得他们知道谁在懈怠中的那些用户名的另一面，而那些人通常很好。</p><p> And one great way to do  that is to host events that give members facetime with each other.</p><p> 还有一个好方法，即举办举办彼此的成员面部的事件。</p><p>  Our event series was called OpenSnack. Since I’m based in San Francisco and Josh is based in Paris, a happy hour didn’t make sense, so we leaned into the idea of community snacktime, and asked folks to bring their favorite snack for show-and-tell.</p><p>  我们的活动系列被称为OpenSnack。由于我在旧金山和乔希以巴黎为主，欢乐时光没有意义，所以我们倾向于社区零食的想法，并询问人们为他们最喜欢的摊类展示展示。</p><p>  About a dozen folks came to the inaugural event, and while that number may seem small, everyone came away with a deeper understanding of every other person on the call.</p><p>  大约十几个人来到了就职事件，而那个数字似乎很小，每个人都越来越深刻地了解电话上的每个人。</p><p> It also created some goofy memories for us to recall together, like when Josh held his fancy French pastry up (a  mille-feuille) to the webcam only for it to slide dramatically off the plate and onto the floor. Or when  Ben shared his Buffalo Wing Cheez-its, as a hilarious foil to Josh’s pastry.</p><p> 它还为我们召回了一些愚蠢的回忆，就像乔希把他的花哨的糕点（一个Mille-Feuille）拿到网络摄像头一样，因为它只是为了它猛烈地从盘子上滑动到地板上。或者当Ben分享他的水牛翼Cheez-它是乔希斯糕点的搞笑箔。</p><p>  Later, when we announced our  Seed Funding, we actually shared the news with our community first during a special edition of OpenSnack. Ahead of the call, we sent registrants a $25 gift card to a food delivery app as a way to share the celebration with the community —  a virtual “snacks on us,” if you will.</p><p>  后来，当我们宣布我们的种子资金时，我们实际上在特殊版本的Opensnack期间将新闻与我们的社区分享。在通话之前，我们将注册人发送了一个25美元的礼品卡给食品送货应用程序作为与社区共享庆祝活动的一种方式 - 如果您愿意，这是一个虚拟的“零食”。</p><p>  So not only did OpenSnack give our community members a chance to put faces with names, it helped create norms and rituals for our community.</p><p>  所以OpenSnack不仅给我们的社区成员提供了一个机会与名称的机会，它帮助为我们的社区创造了规范和仪式。 </p><p> If I had to start over, I’d definitely do more events, and start sooner. I think we would’ve learned more and faster, and generally would’ve accelerated the number of quality connections between our members.</p><p>如果我必须重新开始，我肯定会做更多的事件，并开始迟早。我想我们会更多地学到更多更快，并且通常会加速我们成员之间的质量联系数量。</p><p> Tactically, we&#39;ve used  Luma to create registration pages and connected  Luma to Orbit via Zapier to create activities and tags for each member who registers, making it a snap to see who&#39;s attended any of our events from inside of Orbit.</p><p> 战术，我们使用的LUMA使用Zapier创建登记页面并将卢米连接到轨道，为每个注册的每个成员创建活动和标签，使其成为谁从内部参加我们的任何活动轨道。</p><p>   Several rituals emerged in our early community. First, our team got in the habit of sharing new things shipped in #general on Fridays. This contributed to a sense of momentum and progress. We also tagged folks who suggested the feature, gave feedback, or reported the bugs we&#39;d smashed,  giving us a chance to recognize and thank the folks who took the time to share their ideas or frustrations.</p><p>   我们早期社区出现了几个仪式。首先，我们的团队养成了星期五在#General的新东西分享新事物。这导致了势头和进步的感觉。我们还标记了建议功能，提供反馈或报告的错误的人，或者报告了我们欺骗的虫子，让我们有机会认识并感谢花时间分享他们的想法或挫折的人。</p><p> We also created a set of Orbit-branded emojis that allowed our community to react in especially Orbity ways. These were a big hit, so much so that members asked for the source files to use in other communities ( grab them here).</p><p> 我们还创建了一套轨道品牌的Emojis，使我们的社会尤其是尤其是口服的方式。这些都是一个很大的打击，因此成员要求在其他社区中使用源文件（在这里抓住它们）。</p><p>  The authors of   Get Together point out that, “Another way that people bond over their shared identity is by creating language unique to their community.”</p><p>  聚在一起的作者指出，“另一种方式是人们通过共同身份的债券是通过为他们的社区创造独一无二的语言。”</p><p> Custom emoji may sound silly, but in Slack communities, emojis are used  all the time, so I think they’re a subtle but powerful way to impart a sense of belonging among members through a kind of shared language.</p><p> 自定义表情符号可能听起来很傻，但在松弛的社区中，Emojis一直使用，所以我认为他们是一种微妙而强大的方式，可以通过一种共享语言来赋予成员之间的归属感。</p><p> In fact, our custom emojis were such a hit that they played a part in a key community milestone.</p><p> 事实上，我们的自定义表情符号是如此击中，他们在关键社区里程碑中发挥了一部分。 </p><p> When we hit 100 members in Slack, we commemorated the moment with a limited-run sticker. And what better way to celebrate the moment than with a real-life Orbit-branded 💯 emoji?</p><p>当我们在懈怠中达到100名成员时，我们纪念有限量贴纸的那一刻。以及庆祝瞬间的更好的方法，而不是用现实生活轨道品牌💯emoji？</p><p>    For sticker fulfillment, we used a Typeform to gather mailing info, then  connected the Typeform to Orbit to keep track of who requested a sticker.</p><p>    对于贴纸履行，我们使用TypeForm来收集邮件信息，然后将TypeForm连接到轨道以跟踪谁请求贴纸。</p><p>   I 💜 the Orbit community. Folks are super smart, helpful, and quirky. They support each other, share ideas, and provide us with loads of useful input for the product in particular and community building in general.</p><p>   我♥轨道社区。人们是超级聪明，乐于助人和古怪的。他们相互支持，共享想法，并为我们提供特别和社区建设的产品的有用输入。</p><p> Tactically, the current iteration of the Orbit community involves our  migration from Slack to Discord, picking up the pace of events, broadening the conversation beyond only Orbit users, and more.</p><p> 显而易见的是，轨道社区的当前迭代涉及我们从不和和不和谐的迁移，拿起事件的步伐，扩大只有轨道用户的谈话，更多。</p><p> Just like you, we’re just getting started, and have plenty more to learn. Every community is different, but I hope the ideas and experiences shared here are useful to you as you build and scale a community of your own.</p><p> 就像你一样，我们刚开始，并更多地学习。每个社区都不同，但我希望这里共享的想法和经验对您有用，因为您构建并规模您自己的社区。</p><p>  DevRel teams need tools and models created specifically for our discipline, and not just those adopted from other fields.</p><p>  Devrel Teams需要专门为我们的学科创建的工具和模型，而不仅仅是那些来自其他领域的工具。</p><p> No spam, just insights, product and content updates, event invites, and the occasional space pun.</p><p> 没有垃圾邮件，只是见解，产品和内容更新，事件邀请，以及偶尔的空间双关语。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://orbit.love/blog/a-tactical-guide-to-kickstarting-your-community/">https://orbit.love/blog/a-tactical-guide-to-kickstarting-your-community/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/社区/">#社区</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/guide/">#guide</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
