The big numbers telemetry game often fails to catch the subtility of some changes and how it affects the core as well as the swinging user base. I was intrigued by the &#34; user research&#34; that managed to miss all the people I know using it and/or planning on using it if it were improved. After Containers became main stream, I honestly thought SSB is gonna get some attention as it simply clicks together in my mind. If there&#39;s no intention left, fine, sorry to waste your time. Just had to add my 3.79 cents.</p><p> 感谢您的详细回复。大型遥测游戏通常无法捕捉到某些变化的微妙之处，以及它如何影响核心以及不断变化的用户群。我对＆＃34;感兴趣用户研究设法错过了我认识的所有使用它的人，和/或计划对其进行改进的计划。在Containers成为主流之后，老实说，SSB会引起我的注意，因为它只是在我的脑海中相互呼应。如果没有打算，那就对了，很抱歉浪费您的时间。只需加上我的3.79美分。</p><p>   I would also be interested in the methodology and research of the user research that was conducted.</p><p>   我也会对进行的用户研究的方法论和研究感兴趣。</p><p>   I disagree, many people have been waiting for PWA support in Firefox. Removing this feature, may result in people (including me, a huge Firefox advocate) switching from Firefox, to a browser that supports PWA. I&#39;m very disappointed.</p><p>   我不同意，许多人一直在等待Firefox中的PWA支持。删除此功能可能导致人们（包括我，一位Firefox拥护者）从Firefox切换到支持PWA的浏览器。我很失望。</p><p> I also would like to see the results of the research, Dave was talking about.</p><p> 我也想看看Dave在谈论的研究结果。 </p><p> You should reconsider this decision. It is understandable that currently there might not be enough resources to finish full PWA support, like in competing browsers, but removing it completely will not only make all work done on it a waste of time, but also send wrong signal to some users. Leaving feature hidden under flag for enthusiasts to experiment on and, maybe, even submit patches that will nudge it closer to completion - that would be a bigger win, than removing feature altogether.</p><p>您应该重新考虑这个决定。可以理解，当前可能没有足够的资源来完成对PWA的完全支持，就像在竞争的浏览器中一样，但是完全删除它不仅会浪费所有时间，而且还会向一些用户发送错误的信号。将功能隐藏在标记下，以供发烧友进行试验，甚至提交修补程序以使其接近完成时-与完全删除功能相比，这是更大的胜利。</p><p> With popular game streaming apps on iOS moving to web, PWAs will become even more important than ever, as more users will learn that one can add a &#34;website&#34; to their homescreen on the phone and even on desktop computer. Consider business use cases too, when instead of installing Electron apps system administrator could just allow installing popular apps as PWA on work devices.</p><p> 随着iOS上流行的游戏流媒体应用程序迁移到Web，PWA变得比以往任何时候都更为重要，因为越来越多的用户将了解到可以添加＆＃34; website＆＃34;网站。在手机甚至台式机上将其转到主屏幕。还应考虑业务用例，当系统管理员无需安装Electron应用程序时，仅允许在工作设备上将流行的应用程序安装为PWA。</p><p> I&#39;m still patiently waiting for a day when I will be able to add some regularly used web apps to my desktop and use them as any other program on my computer without any additional installs.</p><p> 我仍然耐心地等待一天，这样我就可以将一些经常使用的Web应用程序添加到桌面上，并将它们用作计算机上的任何其他程序，而无需进行任何其他安装。</p><p> I agree with the previous posters. removing PWA completely is hugely disappointing and a missing feature that will drive users like me to another browser. I like firefox and was holding out for proper pwa support (fwiw the experimental worked well enough), but without this in the pipeline I see less reason to stay invested.</p><p> 我同意以前的海报。完全删除PWA非常令人失望，并且缺少一项功能，该功能会将像我这样的用户带到另一个浏览器。我喜欢firefox，并且一直在寻求适当的pwa支持（实验足够好），但是如果没有这种支持，我会发现没有什么理由继续投资。</p><p> I disagree, many people have been waiting for PWA support in Firefox. Removing this feature, may result in people (including me, a huge Firefox advocate) switching from Firefox, to a browser that supports PWA. I&#39;m very disappointed.</p><p> 我不同意，许多人一直在等待Firefox中的PWA支持。删除此功能可能导致人们（包括我，一位Firefox拥护者）从Firefox切换到支持PWA的浏览器。我很失望。</p><p> We already don&#39;t have the feature working in any decent fashion so I&#39;m not sure removing it will have any impact here.</p><p> 我们已经没有该功能以任何适当的方式工作，因此我不确定删除该功能是否会对这里产生影响。</p><p> I also would like to see the results of the research, Dave was talking about.</p><p> 我也想看看Dave在谈论的研究结果。 </p><p>   You should reconsider this decision.

At this point I don&#39;t think we would accept patches to improve the feature so I don&#39;t think leaving the code in Firefox makes any sort of sense. Speaking as the developer who spent a good deal of time writing most of the code I am frustrated to see it removed too, but it is the decision that makes sense at this time.</p><p> 我希望我们发送的信号是PWA支持不会很快出现在桌面Firefox中。在这一点上，我认为我们不会接受补丁来改进此功能，因此我认为将代码留在Firefox中是没有任何意义的。作为花费大量时间编写大部分代码的开发人员，我很沮丧地看到它也被删除了，但这是明智的决定。</p><p> I am a sys-admin for a multitude of machines. Every single user&#39;s machine I touch has a whatsapp web app installed through chrome on their desktop. This is an extremely sought after feature that users will really appreciate. For Mozilla to stop work on this feature is just a demonstration of their lack of care.</p><p> 我是许多机器的系统管理员。我触摸的每台用户机器都通过Chrome在其桌面上安装了whatsapp网络应用。这是用户将非常欣赏的极为抢手的功能。对于Mozilla来说，停止使用此功能仅是表明他们缺乏照顾。</p><p> I do not understand how Mozilla receives hundreds of millions of dollars and yet is unable to implement even simple and useful features like a chromeless SSB.</p><p> 我不明白Mozilla是如何获得数亿美元的，却无法实现甚至简单无用的功能（例如无边框SSB）。</p><p> All I can say is that I am relieved that Thunderbird is separating from Mozilla and its aloof board of directors.</p><p> 我所能说的是，雷鸟与Mozilla及其超然的董事会分离让我感到宽慰。</p><p>   As a developer, I&#39;d ask firefox team to check if this is what they really want to do. If they don&#39;t, I&#39;m going to suggest my users to move to a chromium alternative.</p><p>   作为开发人员，我要求firefox团队检查这是否是他们真正想要做的。如果他们不这样做，我将建议我的用户改用铬替代品。</p><p> A lot of our bug reports come from firefox users already, while they&#39;re a small percentage of users. I use PWA&#39;s with SSB in my workflow and our users use PWA&#39;s too. Tabs arent a good fit for everything. /end</p><p> 我们的许多错误报告已经来自firefox用户，而他们只是一小部分用户。我在工作流程中将PWA与SSB一起使用，而我们的用户也使用PWA。制表符arent非常适合所有内容。 /结束 </p><p> The signal I hope we are sending is that PWA support is not coming to desktop Firefox anytime soon. At this point I don&#39;t think we would accept patches to improve the feature so I don&#39;t think leaving the code in Firefox makes any sort of sense.

PWA is future of agile apps development. Please let&#39;s consider this decision again. Is there something what the community can do?</p><p> 真伤心！ PWA是敏捷应用程序开发的未来。请让我们再次考虑这个决定。社区可以做些什么吗？</p><p> Additionally, I would like to add that most mobile Linux distributions are shipping desktop Firefox with a stylesheet and some tweaks 1 to make it work on phones. I understand that this is a tiny portion of your market and presumably not within your interests, but on this platform having SSB:s for PWA:s would make a lot of sense if it was properly implemented, I think.</p><p> 此外，我想补充一点，大多数移动Linux发行版都在交付带有样式表的桌面Firefox，并进行了一些调整1使其可以在手机上运行。我知道这只是您市场的一小部分，大概不在您的兴趣范围内，但是我认为，在这个平台上，如果PWA：s拥有SSB：s，那么如果实施得当，将很有意义。</p><p> As I&#39;m using Microsoft Outlook on Mac and Linux using Edge (Chrome)&#39;s PWA feature I&#39;ve been actively tracking Firefox&#39;s implementation. The convenience of not having to hunt down and launch Electron apps, and using the desktop shell to interact with web apps made PWA&#39;s on the desktop (Especially on alternative OS&#39;es) a blessing.</p><p> 当我在Mac上使用Microsoft Outlook和在Linux上使用Edge（Chrome）的PWA功能时，我一直在积极跟踪Firefox的实现。不必搜寻并启动Electron应用程序，以及使用桌面外壳与Web应用程序进行交互的便利，使PWA在桌面（尤其是在替代OS上）上成为一种幸运。</p><p> Removing this from Firefox (or stopping finishing a proper implementation including Dock / Panel icons and proper menu bar) will require me to keep Chrome/Edge around for this purpose. Which I would see as another nail in FF&#39;s coffin tbh...</p><p> 从Firefox中删除它（或停止完成包括Dock / Panel图标和适当的菜单栏的适当实现）将需要我为此保留Chrome / Edge。我认为这是FF棺材中的另一个钉子...</p><p> Great, the moment I discover a feature I needed is when it&#39;s being removed 😅 Do you know if this will affect work on  #1283670, the  --app command-line switch?</p><p> 太好了，当我发现需要的功能时，便是将其删除。you您知道这是否会影响--app命令行开关＃1283670的工作吗？</p><p> Now, on to enable  browser.ssb.enabled. If it does what I hope, I might end up sticking to the last version that supports it for a while. To each one their priorities.</p><p> 现在，启用浏览器.ssb.enabled。如果它能达到我的期望，我可能最终会坚持一段时间支持它的最新版本。对每个人来说都是他们的优先事项。 </p><p> I also agree that the feature would be great. As a user I would definitely use it for streaming platforms like Disney plus.</p><p>我也同意该功能会很棒。作为用户，我肯定会将它用于迪士尼plus等流媒体平台。</p><p> You only refer to some ominous research, which you are not allowed to share, and which:</p><p> 您仅提及一些不祥的研究，不允许您共享，并且：</p><p>  Firstly, this does not seem very transparent. Secondly, how can you justify removing a feature because</p><p>  首先，这似乎不是很透明。其次，您如何证明删除功能是合理的，因为</p><p> The SSB feature has only ever been available through a hidden pref and has multiple known bugs. Additionally user research found little to no perceived user benefit to the feature and so there is no intent to continue development on it at this time.

While everyone (me included!) is tired of waiting for this feature (specially, but among others), I&#39;ll stop the barricade - since it&#39;s me making this call - and let the entire company move on to chrome. That way everyone will be happy!</p><p>   同时，尽管我吞下了一些青蛙，但我会承认Firefox并不关心企业，并停止推动每个人都对这个项目保持信心。虽然每个人（包括我在内）都厌倦了等待此功能（特别是，但不限于此），但我会阻止路障-因为是我打这个电话-让整个公司继续前进铬。这样，每个人都会很高兴！</p><p> Ain&#39;t Mozilla tired of shooting itself in the foot just yet?
