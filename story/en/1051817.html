This, among other reasons, led me to embark on a  marathon of technical interviews – 60+ technical interviews in 30 days .</p><p> 在2020年1月至3月20日之间的某个时候，我想改变工作，并希望加入一家新公司。除其他原因之外，这让我踏上了技术面试的马拉松 -  60多天的技术面​​试。</p><p> Doing that many number of interviews in such a short time meant I had an interesting mix of experiences from the various companies I interviewed with, each with their unique culture and values that often reflected in the way their interviews were conducted, intentionally or not.</p><p> 在这样一个短时间内进行这么多的采访意味着我对我采访的各种公司进行了有趣的经验组合，每个人都有一个独特的文化和价值观，通常反映在他们的访谈中进行的，故意与否。</p><p> In this article, I will be sharing some of the red flags I observed while I was on this marathon of technical interviews. I will not be mentioning names of any companies because that’s not the intent behind this article.</p><p> 在这篇文章中，我将分享我在这次马拉松的技术面试中观察到的一些红旗。我将不会提到任何公司的姓名，因为这不是本文背后的意图。</p><p> The goal of this article is also not to make you paranoid and be on the hunt for red flags in your next interview, far from it. Rather the goal is to equip you with knowledge to help you immediately identify exactly the same or similar red flags in your next interview, and hopefully identifying them will set you up to better handle them.</p><p> 本文的目标也不是让你偏执，并在你的下一次采访中追捕红旗，远离它。相反，目标是为您提供知识，以帮助您立即识别您的下一次面试中完全相同或相似的红旗，并希望识别它们将让您更好地处理它们。</p><p> Even though the stories I’ll be sharing come from my marathon of technical interviews, these red flags do not apply only to technical interviews. They apply to all kinds of interviews and so there’s a lot to learn here for everyone.</p><p> 尽管我将分享的故事来自我的马拉松技术面试，但这些红旗不仅仅适用于技术访谈。他们适用于各种采访，所以在这里有很多东西可以为每个人学习。</p><p>   In the world of computing and in life generally, for any given problem, there is typically more than one way to solve that problem. For example, given a sorting problem, you could solve it using a merge-sort algorithm or a heap sort algorithm.</p><p>   在计算和生活中的世界一般来说，对于任何给定的问题，通常存在多种方法来解决这个问题。例如，考虑到排序问题，您可以使用合并排序算法或堆排序算法来解决它。 </p><p> Having this rich number of techniques to solve a problem makes it even more interesting and the general expectation in technical interviews is that you should have the flexibility to solve a problem using your preferred technique.</p><p>拥有这种富裕的技术来解决问题使其更有趣，在技术访谈中的一般期望是您应该使用您的首选技术来解决问题。</p><p> I had an interview where the interviewer asked me to solve an algorithmic problem. I had started solving the problem using a specific technique when the interviewer stopped me in my tracks and asked that I use another technique.</p><p> 我接受了面试官让我解决算法问题的面试。当面试官在我的曲目中阻止我并要求我使用另一种技术时，我已经开始解决问题。</p><p> When I probed a bit further to know why, it appeared that the reason he asked that I used the second wasn’t to test my knowledge of that second technique; it was because he was more ‘comfortable’ with that approach.</p><p> 当我进一步探究了为什么，它似乎他问我用第二个的原因是不测试我对那项第二种技术的了解;这是因为他的方法更为“舒适”。</p><p> It is different if the interviewer wants to test your knowledge of something very specific. For example, given a problem that can be solved using iteration and recursion, the interviewer may want to test your knowledge of recursion and can ask you to solve the problem recursively. That wasn’t the case here.</p><p> 如果面试官想要测试你对非常具体的东西的知识是不同的。例如，鉴于使用迭代和递归可以解决的问题，面试官可能希望测试您的递归知识，并可以要求您递归地解决问题。这里不是这种情况。</p><p> I ended up using both techniques and discussed the trade-offs but frankly that experience left a bad taste in my mouth especially because that interview was with the hiring manager — my would-be manager, who is someone that can significantly influence your career growth and trajectory.</p><p> 我最终结束了两种技术并讨论了权衡，但坦率地说，经验留下了嘴里的糟糕味道，特别是因为采访与招聘经理 - 我的愿意经理，谁是能够显着影响你职业生长的人弹道。</p><p>  It’s very exciting and fulfilling when you go through all preliminary stages of a technical interview, through to the onsite interview (remote or in-person) and then you receive that “ Congratulations , we are pleased to offer you…” email.</p><p>  当您通过技术面试的所有初步阶段，到现场访谈（偏远或偏远），然后收到“祝贺，我们很高兴为您提供...”电子邮件时，这是非常令人兴奋和令人满意的。</p><p> However, that excitement often becomes short-lived when there is some form of pressure from your soon-to-be employer to accept the offer. It’s a bit more manageable when the pressure comes from someone in HR or the recruiter, but when it’s from the hiring manager, that can be harder to manage.</p><p> 然而，当您很快雇主有某种形式的压力来接受报价时，这种兴奋通常会变得短暂。当压力来自人力资源或招聘人员的压力，而是来自招聘经理时，这有点易于管理，这可能更加困难管理。 </p><p> That was the case for me when I interviewed with a startup based in Palo Alto. They were a small company in terms of staff strength. My onsite interview with them had gone quite well. I had a good conversation with the hiring manager and an even better conversation with the VP of Engineering, so much so that I could tell that I was going to be extended an offer. I asked to know how long I had to accept the offer letter and I was told seventy-two hours.</p><p>当我采访以帕洛阿尔托的初创公司采访时，这就是我的情况。他们是一家在员工实力方面的小公司。我的现场采访已经变得很好。我与招聘经理进行了良好的谈话，也有更好的与工程副总裁的交谈，所以我可以告诉我将要延长报价。我要求知道我需要多久接受要约信，我被告知了七十二个小时。</p><p> The offer letter arrived later that evening, and it looked great — a six-figure offer definitely didn’t seem like a bad start. I was also at the final stage of the interview process with other companies too and thankfully, I had enough time to negotiate and accept the offer, or so I thought.</p><p> 优惠信迟到了那天晚上，看起来很棒 - 一个六位数的报价似乎似乎并不糟糕的开始。我也是其他公司的面试过程的最后阶段，也谢天谢地，我有足够的时间谈判并接受提议，或者我想。</p><p> Then the pressure started, incessant calls from the hiring manager and the VP of Engineering, back-to-back emails, all within the allotted time. So much was the pressure that it got to a point where I wasn’t sure I wanted to negotiate the offer anymore. I turned down the offer.</p><p> 然后，压力开始，来自招聘经理的不断呼叫和工程副总裁，背靠背电子邮件，全部在规定的时间内。这是它到达我不确定我想再谈判报价的一点的压力。我拒绝了这个问题。</p><p> I turned down the offer because the experience got me thinking about the company’s work culture. Were the methods employed by the company to get me to accept the offer indicative of their work culture? If they needed to get something done, how far would they go?</p><p> 我拒绝了这个优惠，因为这些经历让我思考了公司的工作文化。该公司是否雇用的方法是让我接受指示他们的工作文化的报价？如果他们需要完成一些事情，他们会走多远？</p><p> Now don’t get me wrong, yes the company wants to employ you, yes the recruiting team wants to ‘close the deal’ however, it’s very important to pay attention to how the company does this. Do they remain professional about it?</p><p> 现在不要给我错了，是公司想要雇用你，是的招聘团队想要“关闭交易”但是，要注意公司如何实现这一目标是非常重要的。他们仍然专业吗？</p><p> A company’s values go beyond what they say, it shows in what they do and how they do it.</p><p> 公司的价值观超出了他们所说的，它在他们所做的事情和它们的方式中显示。</p><p>  Among the many reasons why you would join a company is your desire to be involved in valuable work. I had the opportunity to join a US company based in Boulder, Colorado. They had contracted a recruiting agency to help them find someone to fill a Software Engineer position in their firm.</p><p>  除了您加入公司的许多原因之中，您希望参与宝贵的工作。我有机会加入科罗拉多州博尔德的美国公司。他们签订了一家招聘机构，帮助他们找到某人在他们公司中填写软件工程师职位。 </p><p> The hiring process started with an exploratory interview with the recruiting agency closely followed by a second interview with a recruiter from the company. In both interviews, I couldn’t get a clear sense of the details of my specific role was — what team I would be on, what kinds of projects I’d be working on, what the career growth pathway was, etc.</p><p>招聘流程始于探索性采访与招聘机构密切关注，然后与本公司的招聘人员进行第二次采访。在两个访谈中，我无法清楚地了解我的具体角色的细节是 - 我将在哪些团队中，我正在努力的哪些项目，职业生长途径等等。</p><p> I understand that sometimes companies can be going through restructuring, but that didn’t seem to be the case here. It seemed more like the company was focused on completing their headcount. Even though there’s nothing wrong with completing a headcount, I think there is everything wrong with not having a clear purpose for a role for a couple of reasons:</p><p> 我明白，有时公司可以通过重组，但这似乎并不是这种情况。它似乎更像是公司专注于完成他们的前线。即使完成了一个人的头部没有错了，我认为有几乎没有错的作用，因为几个原因没有明确的目的：</p><p> It means the role may not be critical to the company’s core business.</p><p> 这意味着角色可能对公司的核心业务至关重要。</p><p> If the role isn’t that important, it may mean when a layoff comes, your position may be impacted.</p><p> 如果角色并不重要，可能意味着裁员来，您的立场可能会受到影响。</p><p> On a more personal note, I don’t want to be just a number. I want to work at a place where I have the opportunity to contribute in an impactful way, and I like to believe you would too. So it’s important to get clarity about your role, for where you are today and for future career growth.</p><p> 在更谨慎的情况下，我不想只是一个数字。我想在一个我有机会以抗议方式贡献的地方，我喜欢相信你也会。因此，对您的角色清楚起见很重要，因为您今天的角色以及未来的职业生涯增长。</p><p>  When looking to join a company, one of the things you simply must care about is the team you will end up working on. At least 25% of your waking hours will be spent interacting with that team whether in-person or virtually.</p><p>  当想加入公司时，你只需关心的东西就是你最终将结束的团队。至少有25％的醒着时间将与该团队进行互动，无论是亲人还是几乎。</p><p> Interviews offer you an opportunity to experience firsthand what it will look like to work with your prospective teammates, especially since, unless you’re interviewing at a huge company, your interviewers are likely to become your teammates.</p><p> 访谈为您提供第一手经历的机会，它可以与您的潜在队友合作，特别是因为您正在参加一家庞大的公司，您的面试官可能会成为您的队友。 </p><p> If through all the different stages of the interview process, you experience a consistent lack of interest or low morale from your interviewers, you might want to pay attention .</p><p>如果通过面试过程的所有不同阶段，您可能会在面试官中遇到一贯缺乏兴趣或低士气，您可能想要注意。</p><p> When I experienced that during one of my interviews, I couldn’t exactly tell what the cause was, but I knew something just wasn’t right. After some internal tussle, I decided to trust my gut feelings and ended the interview process with the company.</p><p> 当我在我的一个采访中经历过时，我不能完全讲述原因是什么，但我知道有什么东西不对。在一些内部争斗之后，我决定相信我的肠道感，并结束了公司的面试过程。</p><p> Fast forward to two months after, two of my interviewers (would-be teammates) had left the company and joined another company (no I wasn’t stalking 🙄, I just checked on LinkedIn ).</p><p> 前进到两个月后，我的两个采访者（愿队队友）离开了公司并加入了另一家公司（不，我没有跟踪🙄，我刚检查在Linkedin上）。</p><p> Now I’m not saying that during the interview process, there won’t be one or two people, who because of their busy schedules, would have preferred to be doing something else rather than interviewing. Yet, when all of the interviewers don’t want to be there, you certainly want to pay attention to that.</p><p> 现在我不是在面试过程中的说法，没有一个或两个人，因为他们忙碌的时间表，谁将愿意做出别的而不是面试。然而，当所有面试官不想在那里时，你肯定想要注意这一点。</p><p> A lack of interest or low morale could be pointers to a combination of any of the following:</p><p> 缺乏兴趣或低士气可能是以下任何一项的指针：</p><p> The team isn’t that interested in you (hard pill to swallow?), maybe they don’t see you as a long-term hire.</p><p> 该团队对你感兴趣（硬丸吞咽？），也许他们没有看到你作为长期租赁。</p><p> Or it could be for reasons that I have not included here, but I implore you to not ignore this red flag if you see it in your next interview.</p><p> 或者可能是因为我没有在这里包含的原因，但如果您在接下来的面试中看到它，我恳请您不要忽略这种红旗。 </p><p>  Have you been in an interview before where the interviewer doesn’t seem to have any questions to ask you? Trust me it can get really awkward.</p><p>在面试官似乎没有疑问的地方，你有没有接受采访？相信我，它会变得非常尴尬。</p><p> That was my experience during a technical phone-screen interview with an educational technology company based in California. The interviewer wasn’t prepared for our interview and didn’t have any questions at hand. He wasn’t even sure of who he was interviewing and what role I was interviewing for. It wasn’t a pleasant experience.</p><p> 这是我在加利福尼亚州教育科技公司的技术电话采访中的经验。面试官没有为我们的采访做好准备，并没有任何疑问。他甚至没有肯定他正在面试，我在面试中的作用。这不是一个愉快的经历。</p><p> I understand that there are a myriad of reasons why interviewers may not be prepared for an interview. Some of which include:</p><p> 我明白，有无数的原因，为什么面试官可能无法准备面试。其中一些包括：</p><p>  I typically won’t act on this red flag in isolation. I will be looking for other red flags in a bid to form a cluster of patterns before making any decision.</p><p>  我通常不会在孤立中对这个红旗作用。在进行任何决定之前，我将在出价中寻找其他红色标志来形成模式。</p><p>  It’s fulfilling to be a part of a company that is involved in meaningful work that creates value for its users. Joining such a company would mean you have the desire to contribute in helping the organization meet its goals. This invariably means the organization must have some goals right?</p><p>  它是作为一家公司涉及有意义的工作的一部分，为其用户创造价值。加入这样的公司意味着您有希望有助于帮助组织达到目标。这总是意味着组织必须有一些目标吗？</p><p> I was contacted by a startup based in San Francisco via AngelList. I had a first introductory call with a recruiter from the company, closely followed by a phone screen technical interview.</p><p> 我是通过昂堡斯特在旧金山的一个创业公司联系。我与公司的招聘人员进行了第一次入门呼叫，紧随其后的电话屏幕技术面试。</p><p> In both interviews, even though the interviewers shared some details about the company, there was a lot of vagueness and about the company’s direction and where the company was headed.</p><p> 在这两次访谈中，即使采访者分享了有关公司的一些细节，也有很多模糊性和公司的方向，公司的指导。 </p><p> I particularly remember that one question I asked at the time, was about how the company would deal with its growing competition. Sadly, the answers I got didn’t seem convincing and the company later got acquired by the competition.</p><p>我特别记住，我当时问的一个问题是，这是如何处理其日益增长的竞争。遗憾的是，我遇到的答案似乎并不令人信服，并且该公司后来被比赛所获得的。</p><p> When you are interviewing to join a company, you are selling more than just your skills, but also yourself — your unique experience. While it’s important to do that, I think it’s equally important that the company should be able to sell you on its vision and what it hopes to achieve.</p><p> 当您在采访加入公司时，您就可以销售不仅仅是您的技能，还可以自己销售您的独特体验。虽然重要的是这样做，但我认为这同样重要的是，该公司应该能够在愿景中销售您以及它希望实现的目标。</p><p> When I think of joining a company, I picture myself in that company for the next 2–5 years. If my vision for where I want to be in my career doesn’t align with the company’s vision, that is a mismatch that shouldn’t be ignored.</p><p> 当我想到加入公司时，我在未来2  -  5年内拍摄了这家公司。如果我想要在我的职业生涯中的愿景并不与公司的愿景保持一致，这是一个不容忽视的不匹配。</p><p>  We sometimes focus more on securing the job which is important. But equally important or even more important than getting the job is staying fulfilled on the job. For me, fulfillment meant joining a company that had a clear vision of where they were headed, working in a role that was critical to the company’s business while being equipped with a lot of growth opportunities.</p><p>  我们有时更多地关注确保重要的工作。但同样重要的或者比获得工作符合工作的同样重要甚至更重要。对我来说，履行意味着加入一家公司，这是一个明确愿景的公司，在他们所在的地方工作，这对公司业务至关重要，同时配备了很多增长机会。</p><p> Hopefully, these red flags I have shared will equip you to make better decisions on what companies you choose to grow your career with. I would generally not advise making a decision based on one or two red flags, but if you see a cluster of red flags, you shouldn’t ignore them. I wish you the best in your career journey.</p><p> 希望，我已分享的这些红旗将装备更好的决定您选择的公司以发展您的职业生涯。我通常不会建议根据一个或两个红旗作出决定，但如果您看到一群红旗，则不应忽略它们。祝你职业生涯中最好。</p><p> If you ever need someone to do a mock interview with you, feel free to schedule one here or you can reach out directly to me on Twitter  @meekg33k .</p><p> 如果您需要有人嘲笑您的采访，请随时安排在这里，或者您可以在Twitter @ Meekg33k上直接与我联系。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://meekg33k.dev/6-red-flags-i-saw-while-doing-60-technical-interviews-in-30-days-ckm53wt5f00avscs13xf9fhcs">https://meekg33k.dev/6-red-flags-i-saw-while-doing-60-technical-interviews-in-30-days-ckm53wt5f00avscs13xf9fhcs</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/面试/">#面试</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/技术/">#技术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/red/">#red</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
