The group essentially implies that Musk isn’t everything he claims to be and issues a veiled warning.</p><p>Hacktivist Group Anonymous于2021年6月5日发出了一条警告信息，以Tesla首席执行官Elon Musk暴露他对他的“骑士”推文的不断操纵比特币的价值。本集团基本上意味着麝香不是他声称的一切以及发出暗示的警告。</p><p> Anonymous is a decentralized international hacktivist collective widely known for its various cyber attacks against several governments, government institutions and government agencies, corporations, and the Church of Scientology. They were the ones who hacked Euro 3.5 million from Paypal in 2012.</p><p> 匿名是一个分散的国际黑客剧集体，广为人知，广为人知，各国各国政府，政府机构和政府机构，公司和科学教会的各种网络攻击。他们是2012年从PayPal攻击350万欧元的人。</p><p> In the video that surfaced on youtube, the group claims that the Tesla CEO holds too much power over the cryptocurrency markets and they are not happy with the way he appears to be so cavalier in his attitude towards them.</p><p> 在Video浮现在YouTube上的视频中，该集团声称Tesla CEO对加密货币市场的权力太大，而且他们对他似乎如此竞争对手的方式并不满意。</p><p>  I wish to remind blockcrunch readers that after Elon Musk’s announcement of bitcoin payment suspension for Tesla cars over bitcoin’s mining energy concerns, the crypto market crashed so badly that nearly a trillion-dollar was wiped off within a week’s time. The market has yet not been able to recover from this shock and his recent cryptic tweet that many in the world of crypto interpreted as the billionaire’s breakup with Bitcoin plunges the market again. Bitcoin’s price slid below $35,000, a far cry from the record $64,802 it traded at in mid-April.</p><p>  我希望提醒BlockCrunch Reader，在Elon Musk对Tesla汽车的比特币支付暂停赛之后，Crypto市场在一个星期的时间内遭到灭亡的近万亿美元。市场尚未从这种震惊中恢复并无法从这个震惊中恢复，他最近的加密世界中的许多人被解释为亿万富翁的分手，比特币再次推动了市场。比特币的价格低于35,000美元，从4月中旬录制的64,802美元的令人愉快的呼喊。</p><p>   Earlier this month a sentiment tracking company  Awario reported that the positive-to-negative sentiment of tweets about Musk reached a new low in May. It simply means that people that are against Elon are growing more than people who favor him.</p><p>   本月早些时候，一家情绪跟踪公司Awario报告说，5月份关于麝香的发推特积极情绪达到了新的低位。它只是意味着对反对埃隆的人比倾向于他的人在一起。</p><p> Elon Musk’s actions are also becoming a concern to Tesla investors as well. Ross Gerber, a longtime Tesla investor, and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth &amp; Investment Management said in an  interview with Yahoo Finance that he thinks Elon is wading into an area that’s maybe not the best set of statements to make. He also warned that manipulating markets and playing with people’s money is a risky strategy for Musk to take.</p><p> Elon Musk的行为也是特斯拉投资者的关注。 Ross Gerber，Longtime Tesla Investor，Gerber Kawasaki财富的首席执行官＆amp;投资管理层在接受雅虎财务采访时表示，他认为艾隆正在趟过一个可能不是最佳陈述的地区。他还警告说，操纵市场和与人民币一起玩的是麝香的风险策略。</p><p>   A famous American football offensive tackle, Russell Okung, launched a billboard campaign featuring himself, suggesting Musk keep out of Bitcoin and focus on space instead. The campaign will run for two weeks in Miami, Florida to coincide with the Bitcoin 2021 conference being held in the city that started on 4th June 2021. He has also placed mobile billboards around SpaceX’s launch site in Texas, and a Tesla facility in California.</p><p>   着名的美国足球攻击性讽刺，拉塞尔okung，推出了一个以自己为特色的广告牌竞选活动，暗示麝香留出了比特币并专注于空间。该活动将在佛罗里达州迈阿密运行两周，佛罗里达州迈阿密将与在2021年6月4日开始的城市中举行的比特币2021会议。他还在德克萨斯州德克萨斯州的Spacex的发射场和加利福尼亚州的Tesla设施中放置了移动广告牌。 </p><p> Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the CEO of Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world by trading volume encouraged his 2.7 million followers saying “Don’t be manipulated. #HODL”. He also said that tweets that hurt other people’s finances are not funny, and irresponsible and reprimanded Musk for joking at the expense of other people’s money.</p><p>Changpeng Zhao（CZ），二进制度首席执行官，通过交易量的世界上最大的加密交换鼓励他的270万追随者说“不被操纵。 #hodl“。他还说，伤害其他人的财务的推文并不好笑，而且不负责任和谴责麝香，以牺牲其他人的钱开玩笑。</p><p>  CZ had mocked Elon Musk before as well over his bitcoin mining energy remark. On May 30, 2021, he tweeted, “When you use electricity to run cars, it’s environmentally friendly. When you use electricity to run the most efficient financial networks in the world, it’s an environmental concern.”</p><p>  CZ在他的比特币采矿能量评论之前嘲笑了Elon Musk。 2021年5月30日，他发了推文，“当你使用电力运行汽车时，它是环保的。当您使用电力运行世界上最有效的金融网络时，这是一个环境问题。“</p><p> When you use electricity to run cars, it’s environmentally friendly.

This has been obvious to your employees for a long time who have faced intolerable conditions under your command for years.It is also obvious to the young children working in your overseas lithium mines which are destroying the local environment as well. You have been open about your willingness to stage coups in order to install dictators in places where your toxic products are being mined. You have even prematurely crowned yourself &#39;Emperor of Mars,&#39; a place where you will be sending people to die.Your fanboys overlook these issues because they are focused on the potential good that your projects can bring to the world but you are not the only show in town and your competition is growing more intense with each passing day.There are plenty of other companies working on space exploration and electric vehicles you are just the only CEO who has gained a cult following through sh*tposting and trolling the world on social media. In fact, many people are not learning that the vast majority of Tesla&#39;s income doesn&#39;t come from selling cars, it comes from government subsidies - selling carbon tax credits for your innovation with clean energyThis technically isn&#39;t your innovation though because you aren&#39;t actually the founder of Tesla. You simply purchased the company from two people much more intelligent than you are - Martin Eberhard and Marc TarpenningTesla has also made more money holding Bitcoin for a few months than they did in years of selling cars.It is also more than likely that this Bitcoin was purchased with money from these government subsidies.It is now widely believed you have been forced to denounce your company&#39;s involvement with Bitcoin in order to keep that green government money flowing into Tesla&#39;s coffers.The energy use argument about proof-of-work mining is a very nuanced conversation that requires a fairly complex understanding of how power grids work and how excess energy is wasted by power companies and sought out by crypto miners.This is a conversation that you have been having for over a year and were intimately aware of but as soon as your main source of income was threatened as your pretended to be clueless in an attempt to play both sides of the fenceThen, your move to create a Bitcoin miner council was rightly seen as an attempt to centralize the industry and take it under your control.Reading the comments on your Twitter posts, it seems that the games you have played with the crypto markets have destroyed lives.Millions of retail investors were really counting on their crypto gains to improve their lives. This is something that you will never understand because you were born into the stolen wealth of a South African apartheid emerald mine and have no clue what struggle is like for most of the working people in the world.Of course, they took the risk upon themselves when they invested, and everyone knows to be prepared for volatility in crypto, but your Tweets this week show a clear disregard for the average working person.As hardworking people have their dreams liquidated over your public temper tantrums, you continue to mock them with memes from one of your million dollar mansions.You may think you are the smartest person in the room, but now you have met your match. We are Anonymous! We are legion. Expect us.</p><p>  世界上的问候是奥隆麝香的匿名公民。在过去的几年里，您已经享有亿万富翁班上任何人最有利的声誉之一，因为你已经挖掘了我们许多人的愿望一个有电动汽车和太空探索的世界，但最近你仔细创造的公共形象正在暴露，人们开始看到你只不过是另一个顽固的富裕的家伙，似乎绝望地注意。似乎你的追求拯救世界是比人类的实际关注，更加植根于优越性和救主复合体。对于您的员工来说，这对您的员工持续了很长一段时间，这对您的员工进行了很长一段时间。对于在您的海外锂矿山工作的幼儿以及正在摧毁当地环境的幼儿也是显而易见的。您愿意愿意暂停政变，以便在所开采的有毒产品的地方安装独裁者。你甚至过早地加冕自己＆＃39;火星皇帝，＆＃39;您将送达人死亡的地方。您的粉丝们忽略了这些问题，因为他们专注于您的项目可以带到世界的潜在良好，但您不是镇上唯一的展会，您的竞争对手越来越激烈通过的一天。有足够的其他公司在太空探索和电动车上工作，您只是唯一通过SH * TPOSTING和拖动世界在社交媒体上的邪教所获得邪教的首席执行官。事实上，很多人都没有学习绝大多数特斯拉＆＃39;虽然收入来自销售汽车，它来自政府补贴 - 通过干净的能量来销售碳税收税，以便在技术上是尚无清洁的。尽管你是因为你的创新，但它实际上是特斯拉的创始人。你只是从两个人那里购买了这家人比你更聪明 - 马丁·埃伯哈德和马尔卡·塔尔彭宁塔斯拉也比多年卖车拿着比特币的钱拿着比特币。这也是这个比特币的可能性也是如此从这些政府补贴的钱购买。它现在被广泛认为，您已被迫谴责您的公司和与比特币的参与谴责，以保持绿色的政府资金流入特斯拉和＃39; S COURCERS。能源使用论证工作验证挖掘是一个非常细致的对话，这需要对电网如何工作以及电力公司浪费的能力以及加密矿工的浪费方式相当复杂地了解。这是一个谈话，你已经过了一个谈话一年并亲密地意识到但一旦你的主要收入来源受到威胁，因为你的假装无能为力地试图打击福特那芬，你的举动就会创造一个b Itcoin矿工委员会被视为试图集中行业，并将其置于您的控制下。阅读您的Twitter帖子的评论，似乎您与加密市场发挥的游戏销毁了生命。零售投资者真正摧毁了居留。依靠他们的加密收益来改善他们的生活。这是你永远不会理解的东西，因为你出生在南非种族隔离翡翠矿山的被盗的财富，并没有任何Clue斗争是世界上大多数劳动人民的斗争。当然，他们自己带来了风险当他们投资时，每个人都知道要在加密中做好准备，但是本周的推文明确无视普通工作人员。勤劳的人有他们的梦想在你的公众发脾气中清算，你继续用模仿嘲笑他们从你百万美元的豪宅中的一个。你可能认为你是房间里最聪明的人，但现在你遇到了你的比赛。我们是匿名的！我们是军团。期待我们。 </p><p> Elon’s recent actions have piled up a lot of bad karma for him. If he doesn’t correct his actions, this might come at a huge cost to Elon Musk as well as all his companies and investors.</p><p>伊隆最近的行动为他堆积了很多坏的业力。 如果他不纠正他的行为，这可能会以伊隆麝香以及他的所有公司和投资者来到巨大的成本。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://blockcrunch.co/2021/06/06/anonymous-warns-elon-musk-for-bitcoin-market-manipulation/">https://blockcrunch.co/2021/06/06/anonymous-warns-elon-musk-for-bitcoin-market-manipulation/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/比特币/">#比特币</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/操纵/">#操纵</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/group/">#group</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/麝香/">#麝香</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
