Then the  success of AirPods only fuelled speculation that an over-ear set of cans had to be coming.</p><p>    自从苹果公司在2014年以30亿美元收购Beats以来，该公司以及越来越不高兴的Beats高管们不得不反复质疑何时发布一些合适的，严肃的Apple耳机。然后，AirPods的成功仅引发了人们的猜测，那就是必须要戴上一套耳罩。</p><p> Finally, all guessing ended in September last year as Jon Prosser leaked images of the then unannounced AirPods Max headphones. By the time Apple unveiled AirPods Max in December, the only thing remaining a genuine surprise was the price: an exceedingly punchy £549.</p><p> 最终，所有猜测都在去年9月结束，因为乔恩·普罗瑟（Jon Prosser）泄露了当时未宣布的AirPods Max耳机的图像。当苹果在12月推出AirPods Max时，唯一真正令人惊喜的是价格：549英镑的超高价。</p><p>  Apple sent out review units that same month, and many instantly proclaimed the AirPods Max a hit. But considering these are a full £200 more than the competitor Sony, B&amp;W or Bose  headphones, we wanted to be sure the Maxes were worth the extra outlay. So we’ve been using them for a whole month, and this is the final verdict.</p><p>  苹果在当月派出了评测装置，许多人立即宣布AirPods Max受到好评。但是考虑到这些价格比竞争对手的索尼，B＆amp; W或Bose耳机高出200英镑，我们希望确保Maxes值得额外的花费。因此，我们已经使用了整整一个月的时间，这是最终裁决。</p><p>     The glib answer would be people with more money than sense. But it’s more complicated than that. AirPods Max are aimed squarely at Apple devotees – of which there are millions – who simply could not bear to be seen with a pair of Beats headphones, even though Beats are superb. No, these people want a grown-up pair of headphones, proper Apple-designed headphones. Well, here they are in all their glory. Yours for half a grand and change.</p><p>     胆怯的答案将是那些拥有更多钱而不是理智的人。但这要复杂得多。 AirPods Max直指Apple奉献者-其中有数以百万计的人-即使Beats很棒，他们也无法忍受戴Beats耳机。不，这些人想要一副成年的耳机，苹果设计的合适耳机。好吧，这是他们的全部荣耀。您的礼物将为您带来一半的回报。</p><p> They are also not aimed at true audiophiles. Why? Because audiophiles are aware of models like Focal’s Stellia and HiFiMan Ananda Wireless or the third generation of Beyerdynamic’s T1, and are willing to pay another few hundred quid, or thousands more, for genuinely astonishing sound reproduction. They are not concerned one bit if the hardware was designed in California. In fact, they’d likely prefer it was designed in Germany.</p><p> 它们也不是针对真正的发烧友。为什么？因为发烧友知道诸如Focal的Stellia和HiFiMan Ananda Wireless或Beyerdynamic的第三代T1之类的型号，并且愿意为真正令人惊讶的声音再现付出另外几百或数千美元的代价。如果硬件是在加利福尼亚设计的，他们一点也不担心。实际上，他们可能更喜欢它是在德国设计的。</p><p>  So will AirPods Max significantly cut into the market share of other high-end noise-cancelling over-ears from the likes of Sony and Bose? I doubt it. Will they bother the genuinely high-end market? No. With AirPods Max, Apple also isn’t cannibalising its own AirPods and AirPods Pro models. There are times when buds are better than over-ear, and vice versa. I’d love to know the proportion of those wanting a pair of AirPods Max headphones also owning AirPods Pros. I’d wager you £549 it’s high.</p><p>  那么，AirPods Max是否会大幅削减Sony和Bose等高端降噪耳机的市场份额？我对此表示怀疑。他们会打扰真正的高端市场吗？不会。Apple还没有蚕食自己的AirPods和AirPods Pro机型。有时候，花蕾比耳塞要好，反之亦然。我想知道那些想要同时拥有AirPods Pro的AirPods Max耳机的人的比例。我向您下注549英镑。 </p><p>    No one can doubt the quality of materials used here. You have a stainless steel headband frame; ear cups hewn from a single piece of aluminium that is then machined, textured and anodised; magnetic removable memory foam cushions; telescoping arms that pull out with just the right amount of resistance; and a headband ‘open knit mesh canopy’ that is ingeniously designed to distribute weight (which it does).</p><p>没有人可以怀疑这里使用的材料的质量。您有一个不锈钢头带框架；用一块铝制成的耳罩，然后进行机械加工，织构化和阳极化处理；磁性可移动记忆泡沫垫；伸缩臂以适当的阻力拉出；还有一个头带“开放式编织网蓬”，这种设计巧妙地用于分配重量（确实如此）。</p><p>  Power is managed by Lightning cable, not USB-C. The Watch’s ‘digital crown’ has been given some steroids and plonked on the right ear cup alongside a noise cancellation button to give you an easy, familiar and physical means of play/pause, skipping tracks and taking calls. All very Apple.</p><p>  电源由Lightning电缆而非USB-C管理。这款手表的“数字表冠”配有一些类固醇，并贴在右耳杯上，旁边有一个消音按钮，可让您轻松，熟悉和物理地播放/暂停，跳过曲目和接听电话。都非常苹果。</p><p>  Then it starts to not be very Apple. The look of the headphones is odd. If you were being unkind you might say they look like someone has stuck some previously-sucked oversized Werther’s Originals onto a headband and sprayed them in metallic paint. Being kind their featureless nature is sleek but makes it look like something is missing. The sheer size of the ear cups is accentuated by the fact there is nothing on the sides, just a clean expanse of aluminium.</p><p>  然后开始不是很苹果。耳机的外观很奇怪。如果您不友善，您可能会说他们看起来好像有人在将一些先前吸过的超大Werther原件贴在头带上，并用金属漆喷涂。善良，他们毫无特色的天性圆滑，但看起来却有些缺失。侧面没有任何东西，只是干净的铝，这突出了耳罩的巨大尺寸。</p><p> There could be a reason for this. It’s been reported (by Prosser, again) that the AirPods Max may have been rushed to market. They weren’t quite ready. Supposedly there were meant to be touch controls built into those large side panels, but to move things along quicker the digital crown was brought in to save the day and allow Apple to get these out for the Christmas spending spree. If true, touch-control sides certainly make sense when you look at the design. That said, I like the physical buttons, even if it is a little too easy to knock the crown and jolt the volume up.</p><p> 这可能是有原因的。据Prosser再次报道，AirPods Max可能已被推向市场。他们还没有准备好。据说原本应该在这些大型侧面板中内置了触摸控制，但是为了更快地移动东西，引入了数字表冠可以节省时间，并可以让Apple在圣诞节期间大肆消费。如果为真，那么当您查看设计时，触摸控制面肯定有意义。话虽如此，我还是喜欢物理按钮，即使敲一下冠和调高音量太容易了。</p><p>   Lastly there is the Smart Case. Much fun has been had online at the expense of the design of the poor Max’s case, and you can see why. But I am not going to join in here. Shooting fish in a barrel is no sport. What is hard to forgive, however, is that it does a very poor job of actually protecting the headphones, surely a key function of any case.</p><p>   最后是Smart Case。糟糕的Max机壳的设计给网上带来了很多乐趣，您可以明白为什么。但我不会加入这里。在桶中射击鱼不是一项运动。但是，很难原谅的是，实际上在保护耳机方面做得很差，这在任何情况下都必不可少。</p><p>     AirPods Max pair effortlessly to an iPhone and are about as intuitive to control as headphones get. The sound is superb - more of that below – and that quality build leaves you in no doubt whatsoever that Apple wants you to feel like these are an expensive bit of kit. The colour choices of silver, space grey, sky blue, pink or green are all tasteful.</p><p>     AirPods Max可以轻松与iPhone配对，并且控制起来就像耳机一样直观。声音是一流的-包括下面的更多内容-高质量的构建无疑使您毫无疑问地想让Apple感觉到这些都是昂贵的工具包。银色，深空灰色，天蓝色，粉红色或绿色的颜色选择都很有品位。</p><p> The 20 hours or so of listening time on a single charge with noise cancellation on is sufficient (this is about the same as the Sony XM4s) and five minutes of charge gets an extra 1.5 hours of listening time. But note there’s no wireless charging, and, as they are never off (the headphones go into standby when taken off and into an “ultra-low-power state” in the Smart Case), you will notice the battery levels dropping between uses.</p><p> 每次充电大约20小时左右的聆听时间就足以消除噪音（这与Sony XM4s差不多），而充电5分钟可获得额外的1.5个小时的聆听时间。但是请注意，没有无线充电，而且由于它们永远不会关闭（耳机在摘下时进入待机状态，在Smart Case中进入“超低功耗状态”），因此您会注意到两次使用之间的电池电量下降。 </p><p> Making and taking calls is also a joy thanks to three microphones. One mic in the left ear cup works with two of the noise cancellation mics to enhance your voice during calls. The H1 chip is brought into play to discern your voice versus background noise, while one of the mics also suppresses wind noise.</p><p>多亏了三个麦克风，拨打和接听电话也很有趣。左耳罩中的一个麦克风与两个降噪麦克风一起使用，可增强通话过程中的声音。 H1芯片可以发挥作用，以识别您的声音和背景噪音，而麦克风之一还可以抑制风噪。</p><p> Park all the good listed above, there are a number of issues, too. The first being weight. Remember that headband open-knit mesh canopy to distribute weight? Well, it is designed to reduce the pressure on the top of your head. It is very clever, and initially works well. But the key point here is why should it be needed at all? It’s needed because AirPods Max are heavy. They feel heavy, and wear heavy. Apple headphones come in at 384.8g. By comparison, the Sony XM4s weigh just 254g.</p><p> 停放上面列出的所有优点，也有很多问题。首先是重量。还记得头带开放式编织网状顶篷来分配重量吗？好吧，它的目的是减轻头顶的压力。它非常聪明，一开始运作良好。但是这里的关键是为什么根本需要它？这是必需的，因为AirPods Max很重。他们感到沉重，穿着沉重。苹果耳机重384.8克。相比之下，Sony XM4s仅重254克。</p><p>  The mesh fools you just long enough to initially think you don’t mind the considerable heft of the Maxes. But walk around with these on for 30 minutes and you start to know you’re wearing them. This should not happen. And you cannot get lost in music or a podcast if you are constantly being reminded of the tech on your head. Perhaps worse still, on occasion the Maxes even started to get uncomfortable during longer sessions well past the hour mark.</p><p>  网格使您愚弄了足够长的时间，以至于最初认为您不介意Maxes的巨大重量。但是穿上这些衣服30分钟，您就会开始知道自己穿着它们。这不应该发生。而且，如果不断提醒您有关技术的信息，您就不会迷失在音乐或播客中。也许更糟的是，有时Maxes在甚至超过小时的较长时间里甚至开始变得不适。</p><p>    Undoubtedly the sound reproduction. The AirPods Max are a feast for the ears. Apple has designed its own 40mm driver, and has done an exceptional piece of work here. I started to hear elements in familiar songs I had never noticed before. Not only are highs crisp and bass notes resonant, the whole soundstage, track after track, including the mid tones, is impressively balanced. Apple says the AirPods Max can maintain total harmonic distortion of less than one per cent across the entire audible range, even at maximum volume, and I believe it. You cannot make these headphones perform poorly, whatever you do to them.</p><p>    无疑是声音的再现。 AirPods Max是耳听的盛宴。苹果设计了自己的40mm驱动器，并在这里做了出色的工作。我开始听到从未听过的熟悉歌曲中的元素。不仅高音清脆，贝司音调共鸣，整个音场，音轨（包括中音）也达到了令人印象深刻的平衡。苹果公司表示，即使在最大音量下，AirPods Max仍可以在整个可听范围内将总谐波失真保持在不到1％的水平，我相信这一点。无论您对它们做什么，都不能使这些耳机的性能变差。</p><p> What’s more, an adaptive EQ measures the sound signal being delivered and adjusts the low and mid frequencies in real time based on how AirPods Max fit and seal around your ears, even supposedly taking into account glasses, ear piercings and different hairstyles. I have no ear piercings, and it’s lockdown three so a haircut’s out of the question, but, yes, I couldn’t hear any difference in sound if I wore my glasses or not.</p><p> 此外，自适应均衡器会根据AirPods Max贴合和密封耳朵的方式实时测量所传送的声音信号并实时调整低频和中频，甚至可以考虑将眼镜，耳洞和不同的发型考虑在内。我没有耳洞，它的锁定力为三，所以理发是不可能的，但是，是的，无论是否戴眼镜，我都听不到声音上的差异。</p><p> Now, this doesn’t mean that the sound quality of AirPods Max best the competition. Far from it. Sound is a subjective thing, and whether they are ever so slightly better or worse than the Sony or Bose or B&amp;W competitors is for you to judge. Some days I felt one way, others another – and, a month in, still do. What I can tell you with assurance is that they are comparable. This is clearly not a win, however, for the AirPods Max. A £200 price premium demands that these headphones should be thrashing the sound reproduction of the MX4s – but they do not.</p><p> 现在，这并不意味着AirPods Max的音质能在竞争中脱颖而出。离得很远。声音是一个主观的东西，它们是否比Sony或Bose或B＆amp; W竞争对手好还是差？有时候，我感到一种方式，而另一些则-一个月后，仍然如此。我可以肯定的告诉你，它们是可比的。但是，对于AirPods Max而言，这显然不是胜利。 200英镑的价格溢价要求这些耳机应能打击MX4的声音再现，但事实并非如此。</p><p>   Why anyone who is interested in sound would buy these ahead of the  Sony WH-1000XM4 or B&amp;W PX7 is hard to fathom. The AirPods Max are not just a bit more pricey than their sonically-as-good competitors, they’re at a level where you could get some XM4s and then treat yourself to some AirPods Pros for the same total spend.</p><p>   为什么对声音感兴趣的人会在Sony WH-1000XM4或B＆amp; W PX7之前买这些东西，这很难理解。 AirPods Max不仅比其出色的竞争对手贵一点，而且它们的价格还可以让您购买一些XM4，然后以相同的总费用使用AirPods Pro。 </p><p> I believe in a union of form and function, and Apple has dragged a reluctant tech world into realising this is key to success, and we are all benefitting from this. But, even for Apple, this feels a step too far. And we’ve been here before. The last time I felt this way was when Apple announced the price of its first HomePod. And look what happened there.</p><p>我相信形式和功能的结合，并且苹果公司拖累了一个勉强的技术界，使他们意识到这是成功的关键，我们都从中受益。但是，即使对于苹果公司来说，这也感觉太过分了。我们以前来过这里。我最后一次感觉是这样，当时苹果公司宣布了其首款HomePod的价格。看看那里发生了什么。</p><p>  No. Apple has been on such a good run recently with iPad Air, AirPods Pro, M1 Macs and the iPhone 12 that you’d be forgiven for thinking it can’t take a misstep. But like the first Apple Watch, the AirPods Max don’t feel quite ready. If Apple can reduce the weight, reduce the price and possibly instate, or reinstate, those touch controls, then these will be class-leading headphones to match the superb sound they already produce. So wait to see what happens with version two, and hope Apple doesn’t take as long to do a refresh as it did with HomePod.</p><p>  不会。Apple最近在iPad Air，AirPods Pro，M1 Macs和iPhone 12上运行良好，您以为它不会走错路而被原谅。但是，就像第一款Apple Watch一样，AirPods Max感觉还不太成熟。如果Apple可以减轻重量，降低价格，并可能恢复或恢复这些触摸控件，那么这些耳机将是一流的耳机，以匹配他们已经产生的出色音质。因此，请等待第二版的变化，并希望Apple不需要像HomePod那样花那么长时间进行刷新。</p><p>       💬 Left WhatsApp recently?
