Before that, Wayne helped him create presentations at NeXT and Pixar. He is writing a book about what it was like on the inside.</p><p>韦恩·古德里奇（Steve Steve）回到苹果后，史蒂夫（Steve）所做的每一个主旨演讲都是制作人。在此之前，韦恩曾帮助他在NeXT和Pixar上创建演示文稿。他正在写一本关于里面的样子的书。</p><p> This is a panel conversation, which works the same on Cake as panels do in the real world: the audience may be vast, but it’s in everyone’s interest to let the panel speak. You can add energy to Wayne’s fascinating stories in this conversation with emojis like   😱 , just like clapping and laughing does in a physical-world panel. To post comments &amp; questions check out   this conversation .</p><p> 这是一个小组对话，在Cake上的作用与现实世界中的小组相同：受众可能很多，但让所有人发言都符合所有人的利益。您可以在对话中使用诸如😱之类的表情符号为韦恩的有趣故事增添活力，就像在物理世界面板中拍手和大笑一样。发表评论＆amp;问题可以检验这个对话。</p><p> Wayne, we knew each other at NeXT when you were working in hardware product marketing. At the time, I had the harrowing but amazing experience of  helping Steve do his Unix Expo keynote.</p><p> 韦恩，当您从事硬件产品营销时，我们在NeXT彼此认识。当时，我在帮助Steve做他的Unix Expo主题演讲方面经历了痛苦而令人惊奇的经历。</p><p> I was, but when NeXT stopped making hardware they laid me off. A week later, Steve called me and started to say “okay Wayne, we need to...” I interjected “what do you mean we need to? You laid me off.” He said “oh” and then click.</p><p> 我当时是，但是当NeXT停止制造硬件时，他们解雇了我。一周后，史蒂夫给我打了个电话，开始说：“好吧，韦恩，我们需要……”我插话说：“你是什么意思？你解雇了我。”他说“哦”，然后单击。</p><p> Eight months later I heard from my brother, who was still working customer support, “Steve wants you to call. He won’t call you but you should call him.” The result of that conversation led to working directly with Steve on all his most important presentations at Pixar and Apple for nearly the next two decades.</p><p> 八个月后，我听到仍在为客户服务的哥哥表示：“史蒂夫希望您致电。他不会给您打电话，但您应该给他打电话。”对话的结果导致在接下来的近二十年中，史蒂夫直接与史蒂夫在皮克斯和苹果公司进行了所有最重要的演讲。</p><p>  Yes, I’m working on it because I was a a unique Insider for 20 years and I&#39;m disappointed at the liberties that people like Aaron Sorkin have taken. I would have gladly helped tell the story the way it really happened, or at least lent some credibility to the parts that should have been historically correct.</p><p>  是的，我正在努力，因为我是20年来独一无二的内幕人士，而我对像亚伦·索金（Aaron Sorkin）这样的人所享有的自由感到失望。我本来会很乐意帮助讲述这个故事的真实发生方式，或者至少对历史上应该正确的部分提供了一定的可信度。</p><p> I spoke to Andy Hertzfeld about that. He said Aaron explained that he was making a painting, not a photograph. It’s not supposed to be a documentary, so he felt he had creative license.</p><p> 我谈到了安迪·赫兹菲尔德。他说亚伦解释说他是在画画，而不是照片。它不应该是纪录片，所以他觉得自己有创作许可证。 </p><p> I know they&#39;re making movies, but let&#39;s at least get some of the real stuff in there about who Steve was. Let&#39;s not purposely put fictitious information into the world that people are going to believe was reality. That’s just wrong in my opinion.</p><p>我知道他们正在拍电影，但是至少我们可以从中获得有关史蒂夫是谁的真实信息。我们不要故意将虚构的信息投放到人们会认为是现实的世界中。我认为那是错误的。</p><p> I’ve heard people say that Steve’s iPhone launch was the greatest presentation in business history. It had heroes and villains, plot twists, humorous sidebars… Did the time you and Steve spend with Pixar influence his keynotes?</p><p> 我听说有人说史蒂夫（Steve）推出的iPhone是企业历史上最伟大的演讲。它有英雄和恶棍，情节曲折，幽默的侧边栏……您和Steve在Pixar上度过的时间是否影响了他的主题演讲？</p><p> Oh, absolutely! If you look at the primitive narratives in Steve’s presentations at NeXT, you can see the influence that our experience at Pixar had on the storytelling over time that resulted in events like the iPhone launch.</p><p> 哦，绝对！如果您在NeXT上Steve的演讲中看到原始的叙述，您会发现随着时间的流逝，我们在皮克斯的经历对故事的影响，这些事件导致了iPhone的发布。</p><p> What few people realize is that, like Pixar movies, there is a color scheme throughout the 90 minutes, and an emotional ramp. And yes there are heroes and villains, action sequences, humor and plot twists. You have to be careful not to wear the audience out. You have to manage building to a climax. Steve understood this better than anyone.</p><p> 很少有人意识到，就像皮克斯的电影一样，整个90分钟都有配色方案，而且情绪激动。是的，有英雄和反派，动作序列，幽默和情节曲折。您必须小心，不要使观众疲倦。您必须将建筑管理推向高潮。史蒂夫比任何人都了解这一点。</p><p>  Quite a lot! That’s the thing, no other CEO would have imagined spending the time Steve invested in his keynotes. For the most important ones, we started 3 or so months out. He would run the company until maybe 2:00 pm and then spend a few hours with me. Then he may start in again in the evening, me at my house and him at his, and we’d stay up until midnight. Sometimes we’d be at it again at 6 am.</p><p>  非常多！就是这样，没有其他CEO会想到Steve将时间花在他的主题演讲上。对于最重要的问题，我们开始了3个月左右的时间。他将经营公司直到下午2:00，然后陪伴我几个小时。然后他可能会在晚上再次开始，我在我家，他在他家，我们要熬夜到午夜。有时我们会在早上6点再次出现。</p><p> I saw part of my job—and Steve never knew this—as managing his emotional ramp to the event. I’ve even described my job much like being a product manager. There were all kinds of things that could mess that up: the product timing, or the photos that were taken weren’t good enough, or he had a bad day, or we didn’t have all the assets he needed… or at times too many!</p><p> 我看到了自己工作的一部分，而史蒂夫从来不知道这一点，这是他管理自己对事件的感激之情。我什至描述了我的工作，就像担任产品经理一样。各种各样的事情都可能使事情变得混乱：产品的时间安排或所拍摄的照片不够好，或者他过得不好，或者我们没有他需要的所有资产……或者有时太多！</p><p> With movies, you never want anything to affect suspension of belief. You want your audience to stay in that magical moment and not think about how things are done.  With the iPhone, we wanted to show that if you rotate your phone to landscape mode, the photo would automatically rotate too. But we were not projecting a video of the actual iPhone that Steve was holding in his hand, only the video from the iPhone. That would have made it shaky on the big screen with distracting reflections.</p><p> 对于电影，您永远都不想让任何事情影响信仰的中止。您希望听众留在那神奇的时刻，而不想想事情如何完成。对于iPhone，我们希望表明，如果将手机旋转到横向模式，照片也会自动旋转。但是，我们并不是在投影史蒂夫手里拿着的实际iPhone的视频，而只是投影来自iPhone的视频。那会使它在大屏幕上摇摇欲坠，并分散注意力。 </p><p> So we showed a graphic of an iPhone, to look like the Keynote slides, and projected Steve’s demo iPhone screen into the exact right position in the graphic. The trick was that when Steve rotated the iPhone to landscape mode, the right thing to do to keep customers in the moment was to rotate the iPhone graphic with its inserted video feed rotating in sync as well. But how?</p><p>因此，我们展示了一个iPhone的图形，看起来像是Keynote幻灯片，然后将Steve的演示iPhone屏幕投影到了图形中的正确位置。诀窍在于，当史蒂夫（Steve）将iPhone旋转到横向模式时，让客户保持眼前的正确做法是旋转iPhone图形，同时使其插入的视频供稿也同步旋转。但是如何？</p><p> It took a month for one of the brilliant Apple engineers to work out how to do this. It looked natural to the audience and no one had to think about how it happened.</p><p> 一位出色的Apple工程师花了一个月的时间来研究如何做到这一点。对观众来说，这看起来很自然，而且没有人需要考虑它是如何发生的。</p><p> When Steve saw this happen he first time, he knew it’d be magic and it had to be shown live. He rotated it back and forth several times in his demo and no one ever questioned what they were seeing because it looked exactly they way it should.</p><p> 当史蒂夫（Steve）第一次见到这种情况时，他知道这很神奇，必须现场直播。他在演示中来回旋转了几次，没有人问过他们所看到的是什么，因为它看起来完全符合他们的预期。</p><p> If I remember, the internal estimate of the marketing power of the iPhone demo Steve did that day was in excess of $1 billion of PR spend from demo until we shipped.</p><p> 如果我还记得的话，iPhone演示史蒂夫当天所做的营销能力的内部估计超过了演示所花的10亿美元，直到我们出货为止。</p><p> Amazing! Did he take feedback from other people at Apple as the presentation was being constructed?</p><p> 惊人！在演示文稿制作过程中，他是否从其他人那里得到了反馈？</p><p> He did. We learned from the creative process Pixar uses: iteration in front of people who can shape it by adding constructive feedback. We held high level slide and demo reviews in the town hall facility with people from each group that would be affected by the presentation. These would happen usually a week or two before the event and rehearsals onsite.</p><p> 他做到了。我们从皮克斯的创作过程中学到了：在可以通过添加建设性反馈来塑造它的人们面前进行迭代。我们在市政厅的设施中进行了高级别的幻灯片和演示审查，每个小组的人员都会受到演示的影响。这些通常会在活动和现场排练之前的一两个星期发生。</p><p> Steve was incredibly demanding when I was at NeXT and a lot of people didn’t last. How did you make it 20 years?</p><p> 当我在NeXT时，史蒂夫的要求令人难以置信，很多人都没有坚持下去。您是如何做到20年的？ </p><p> I know that I quit 3 times, one kind of officially via email to HR. God only knows how many times I was actually yelled at and fired but it never went anywhere. Essentially I never really wanted to leave so I didn’t.</p><p>我知道我辞职了3次，一种是通过电子邮件正式发送给HR。上帝只知道我实际上遭到过大吼大叫和被开除的次数，但从未到过任何地方。本质上，我从来没有真正想过离开，所以我没有离开。</p><p> That’s insane. I read an interview of Andy Cunningham who said, “I loved working for Steve Jobs even though he fired me 5 times.” What do you mean it never went anywhere?</p><p> 太疯狂了我读了安迪·坎宁安（Andy Cunningham）的专访，他说：“即使乔布斯解雇了我5次，我仍然喜欢为史蒂夫·乔布斯工作。”那是什么意思</p><p> One afternoon he told me, “God dammit, Wayne. I want you to fucking go home right now and tell me why I shouldn’t fire you tomorrow.” So I went home that night and I probably worked on 15 or 16 versions of an email trying to explain everything. But then I just decided to say “Steve, you know how I feel, but you’re the boss. You let me know tomorrow whether I’m fired or not.” I never heard another word about it.  The mythology of him mostly comes from individuals that didn&#39;t survive around him. The people who got close knew the rules, knew how to work with him, knew his core desires and what he was trying to achieve. They never really had problems with it.</p><p> 一天下午，他告诉我：“天哪，韦恩。我想让你现在就回家，告诉我为什么明天我不应该解雇你。”因此，那天晚上我回家了，我可能处理了15或16个版本的电子邮件，试图解释所有内容。但是后来我决定说：“史蒂夫，你知道我的感受，但你是老板。你明天让我知道我是否被解雇。”我再也没有听到过这句话。他的神话大部分来自没有在他周围生存的人。亲密的人知道规则，知道如何与他合作，知道他的核心愿望以及他想要实现的目标。他们从来没有真正遇到过问题。</p><p> Someone told me early on that if you do something great, you just have to acknowledge it yourself because you’re not going to get it from him except on a rare occasion. A lot of people who weren’t used to that would come in to present their product plan or whatever, and they would be seeking to make themselves look good and get praise from Steve. If he got a whiff of that, he would rip you down a peg.   He was usually right because the person usually didn’t do a great job. Those are the ones who flamed out and then had the horrible things to say because they couldn’t admit to themselves that they couldn’t cut the mustard.  He was a complex individual but he always desired the best out of everybody. He was ultimately very caring. He had his own relationship with my daughter from the age of 4 years old and let her come to rehearsals and events. He even asked her opinion a few times when the team couldn’t decide between particular graphics to use.</p><p> 有人早些时候告诉我，如果你做的很棒，那你只需要自己承认就可以了，因为除了极少数的情况下，你不会从他那儿得到的。许多不习惯的人会提出他们的产品计划或其他任何东西，他们将设法使自己看起来不错，并得到史蒂夫的称赞。如果他有这种想法，他会把你撕碎。他通常是对的，因为这个人通常做得不好。那些人大发雷霆，然后说出可怕的话，因为他们无法承认自己无法割下芥末。他是一个复杂的人，但他始终希望每个人都能做到最好。他最终非常关心。他从4岁起就与我的女儿建立了自己的关系，并让她参加彩排和活动。当团队无法在要使用的特定图形之间做出决定时，他甚至问了她几次意见。</p><p> Give us an example of when he went off on you because he expected better.</p><p> 给我们举一个例子，说明他什么时候对你发火，因为他期望更好。</p><p> When we launched the Lifesaver iMacs (the color ones), Steph Adams [Owner of Adams &amp; Asscociates—the outside production company for Apple] and I were trying to bring them out from behind the screen and raise them up out of their pedestals. A week before the event and we were still struggling to synchronize them and make the motion smooth. This was before computer-controlled movement machinery was readily available.  After mentioning this to Steve, he literally says, “I know the guys from Cirque du Soleil, why don’t you call them?” With one week left, we couldn’t do that so we stuck with our way. It was a hand-crank thing. When you looked at it close, it was really bad. But when you were in the audience, you couldn’t tell unless you knew what to look for. However, Steve was on the stage watching these things not perfectly aligned with a little bit of stuttering. He wasn’t happy and we could see it in the video feed we were watching.  The show went off, no one ever noticed or mentioned it in the press, but yet he noticed. He pulled me and Steph aside. There were people all around so he didn’t scream or yell at us. It was one of those “I’m really disappointed. At any other time I’d probably fire you.” For ten minutes he went on and on. We looked at each other and just melted into the floor.  But we came back the next show having done our research. We now had the beginnings of our computer-controlled systems. We could bring things from the back of the stage, under the stage, or out of a cabinet—and twirl them as they emerged. Cirque du Soleil couldn’t do it better than we did it.  As I look back, if we had not been berated so much, we wouldn’t have seen that these were amazing products and they could have been launched so much better.</p><p> 当我们推出Lifesaver iMac（彩色）时，Steph Adams [Adams＆amp; Asscociates（Apple的外部制作公司），我正试图将它们从屏幕后面拿出来，并从底座上抬起。活动开始前一周，我们仍在努力使其同步并使动作平稳。这是在计算机控制的运动机械问世之前。在向史蒂夫提到这件事之后，他从字面上说：“我认识太阳剧团的家伙，为什么不给他们打电话呢？”剩下一个星期，我们无法做到这一点，因此我们坚持了自己的方式。这是一件手摇的事。当您近距离观察时，确实很糟糕。但是当您在观众席中时，除非您知道该寻找什么，否则您将无法分辨。但是，史蒂夫（Steve）在舞台上看着这些东西并没有一点点卡顿。他不开心，我们可以在观看的视频Feed中看到它。演出开始了，没有人在媒体上注意到或提及它，但是他注意到了。他把我和斯蒂芬拉到一边。到处都是人，所以他没有对我们尖叫或大喊。那是“我真的很失望。在其他时间，我可能会开除您。”他持续了十分钟。我们看着对方，只是融化在地板上。但是我们完成了我们的研究之后又回到了下一个节目。现在，我们有了计算机控制系统的开始。我们可以从舞台的后面，舞台下或橱柜里拿出东西，并在它们出现时旋转它们。太阳马戏团没有比我们做的更好。当我回头看时，如果我们没有受到太多的谴责，我们将不会看到这些产品是令人赞叹的产品，而且它们本可以发布得更好。</p><p> When I did his keynotes at NeXT, I don’t remember him ever being scripted. Did that change?</p><p> 当我在NeXT上做他的主题演讲时，我不记得他曾经被写过脚本。改变了吗？ </p><p> That’s the thing most executives don’t get. We never wrote a script. The preview monitor was just the next slide coming up. The Keynote development, the slide sequencing, the simplifying and honing were all part of his method for being as empathetic, emotive, charismatic and precise as he was on stage. It came from time spent working on the story with his slides, then rehearsing and rehearsing and rehearsing. Not from a script.  It was just part of him. There is a dichotomy in the world about the mythology surrounding him. A big part of his legacy comes from what people saw of him on stage. He was at his absolute best then. He was putting 110% of himself into it because he didn’t want to let the rest of the company down. He was introducing his creations to the world, they were like his children. Steve had an immediate trust factor with the audience because he was so bare and open at those moments in time.  After each show he would come to the back of the stage and ask Steph and I to grade him. And we would say it was a B, or B- or solid A. He really wanted to know how he did so if not great, he/we could do better next time. If you watch different keynotes, you can see that he had different emotional ramps depending on whether it was a product he was totally into or not.</p><p>这是大多数高管无法获得的。我们从未写过脚本。预览监视器只是下一张幻灯片。 Keynote开发，幻灯片排序，简化和磨练都是他在舞台上表现出的同理心，情感，魅力和精确度的方法的一部分。这是因为他花了一些时间在幻灯片上处理故事，然后进行彩排，彩排和彩排。不是来自脚本。那只是他的一部分。关于他周围的神话世界上存在分歧。他的遗产很大一部分来自人们在舞台上看到他的东西。那时他处于最佳状态。他之所以投入110％，是因为他不想让公司的其他成员失望。他向世界介绍他的作品，就像他的孩子一样。史蒂夫对观众有直接的信任感，因为他那时光秃秃，空旷。每场演出结束后，他都会回到舞台的后面，请斯蒂芬和我给他打分。我们会说它是B或B或实心A。他真的很想知道他的表现如何（如果不是很好的话），他/我们下次可以做得更好。如果您观看不同的主题演讲，您会发现他在情感上有不同的变化，这取决于他是否完全钟情于该产品。</p><p>  I don’t think so in business. I would get calls asking “Can you help us do a keynote like Steve?” (which we affectionately called Stevenotes). But they always had the expectation that I would write a script and build the slides in their entirety. They had no understanding of what it really took to master this medium.</p><p>  我不认为这是生意。我会接到电话问“您能帮助我们做史蒂夫这样的主题演讲吗？” （我们亲切地称其为Stevenotes）。但是他们一直期望我会编写脚本并完整地构建幻灯片。他们不了解掌握这种媒介的真正需要。</p><p>  Something hit me during the memorial at Stanford when I was among the 400 or so close friends and colleagues he had worked with. Each of them had ten or maybe a hundred stories to tell about Steve. If that’s not a testament to someone’s character, then what is? That’s how you know someone left a mark, made a difference, changed things. I got goosebumps when I thought about that.  I thought that I should write many of my stories, events and moments that I shared with Steve in some form that others might enjoy. I’ve told many of these stories to friends in person and they usually say, “you should write a book!”. So I’m working on one.  There’s a lot of information out there from journalists or impressions from his presentations. But stories from people who worked closely with him for decades fill in the painting, as you mentioned earlier Chris, of who he really was.</p><p>  在斯坦福纪念馆举行的纪念活动中，有件事让我印象深刻，当时我与他一起工作的400多个亲密朋友和同事中。他们每个人都有十个甚至一百个故事来讲述史蒂夫。如果这不能证明某人的性格，那是什么？这样您才能知道有人留下了印记，有所作为，改变了一切。考虑到这一点，我感到鸡皮ump。我认为我应该以其他人可能会喜欢的形式写很多与史蒂夫分享的故事，事件和时刻。我已经亲自向朋友讲了许多这样的故事，他们通常会说：“你应该写一本书！”。所以我正在研究一个。记者们提供了很多信息，或者他的演讲给人留下了深刻的印象。但是，正如您前面提到的克里斯所说，来自与他数十年紧密合作的人的故事充斥着这幅画。</p><p>  Follow this conversation to get notified about new posts.
