This deal – reportedly worth over $100 million – is one of the most lucrative podcast deals. The presence of this deal, let alone the magnitude, is rare for the podcast ecosystem, which is built on open principles  i.e. all podcasts are available everywhere. Therefore, the concept of exclusivity does not exist in the vocabulary of podcast listeners nor podcast creators. For Spotify to spend a considerable sum of money on a medium that is not its core business  (i.e. music) represents a significant shift in strategy. In this blog, I explore why Spotify is embarking on this journey, and the value Spotify can deliver in this space.</p><p>订阅与今年早些时候的最新更新进行联系，当Spotify宣布“Joe Rogan经验”将完全流播放Spotify，它在整个播客生态系统中发送了ShockWaves。这项交易 - 据报价超过1亿美元 - 是最有利可图的播客优惠之一。这笔交易的存在，更不用说幅度，对于播客生态系统来说是罕见的，这是建立在开放原理中的播客。所有播客无处不在。因此，播客侦听器的词汇表或播客创建者的词汇不存在排他性概念。对于Spotify，在不是其核心业务（即音乐）的媒体上花费大量资金（即音乐）代表策略的重大转变。在这个博客中，我探索为什么Spotify正在开始这段旅程，并且价值Spotify可以在这个空间中提供。</p><p>  To understand this sudden shift in strategy, we need to understand the current state of the podcast industry.  According to Statista,</p><p>  要了解战略的突然转变，我们需要了解播客行业的当前状态。根据Statista，</p><p> Back in 2006, only 22 percent of the adult population in the United States was aware of podcasting. By 2020, this figure had risen to 75 percent. Podcasting is an increasingly popular pastime in the US, and there were an estimated 88 million podcast listeners in the country in 2019. Forecasts suggest that the number of podcast listeners will surpass 160 million in 2023 after increases of around 20 million each year.</p><p> 回到2006年，美国只有22％的成年人人口都意识到播客。到2020年，这个数字已经上升至75％。 Podcasting是美国越来越受欢迎的消遣，2019年该国有一个估计的8800万播客听众。预测表明，播客听众的数量将在每年增加约2000万后超过2023年的人数超过1.6亿。</p><p> When consumers are not in Spotify’s app listening to music, they are listening to podcasts in a different app. This represents a threat to Spotify’s ad-supported free product and a loss of ad-revenue from its free users  (Spotify’s premium product is not affected by this because the subscription cost per user is fixed regardless of listening time). To serve relevant ads and, in return, increase its CPM for advertisers, Spotify needs to know its users intimately. This means that Spotify needs its users to spend as much of their digital lives as possible in its walled garden. The quickest way for Spotify to enable this is to build a podcast streaming capability and stream all available podcasts through its music app. This is precisely what Spotify started doing in 2018. Since then, Spotify has quickly ramped up the number of podcast titles available on its platform with increasing engagement every quarter.</p><p> 当消费者不在Spotify的应用程序听音乐时，他们正在聆听不同的应用程序中的播客。这代表了Spotify的广告支持的免费产品的威胁，并从其免费用户丢失的广告收入（Spotify的Premium产品不受此影响，因为无论收听时间如何，每个用户的订阅费用都是固定的）。为了提供相关的广告，换取，增加其CPM为广告商，Spotify需要密切地了解其用户。这意味着Spotify需要用户在其围墙的花园中尽可能多地花费他们的数字生活。 Spotify启用的最快方式是通过其音乐应用程序构建播客流程和流式传输所有可用的播客。这正是在2018年开始做的那样。从那时起，Spotify迅速增加了其平台上可用的播客标题的数量，并在每季度增加参与。</p><p>  It is important to understand the open podcast ecosystem before moving forward. Podcasts are delivered through a technology called RSS (Rich Site Summary). If you’ve seen this icon on the internet before, then you have come across an RSS feed.</p><p>  在前进之前了解开放播客生态系统非常重要。播客通过名为RSS（Rich Site Suide）的技术提供。如果您之前在互联网上看到了这个图标，那么你已经遇到了RSS饲料。</p><p>  An RSS feed acts as a content-distribution tool and is often used by websites to distribute web content such as new articles, blogs, and podcasts. It is an XML file that holds metadata and location of the podcast content, which in most cases, is the audio file.</p><p>  RSS Feed充当内容分发工具，通常由网站使用，以分发Web内容，例如新的文章，博客和播客。它是一个XML文件，该文件包含元数据和播客内容的位置，在大多数情况下，它是音频文件。</p><p> The publisher sets up a public RSS feed URL which is used by the listener in a podcast player to subscribe to the podcast i.e. the podcast player downloads new episodes as they are published. Of course, in modern times, any capable podcast app indexes the most popular podcasts and provides users with search functionality to discover the podcasts rather than inputting podcast URLs. Notice the beauty of this ecosystem because both sides of this publisher-listener transaction are open. On the publisher side, the podcast feed URL is available publicly without any authentication to be consumed by anybody who understands the XML structure of the feed. On the listener side, the listener is free to use their favorite podcast player ( there are many out there…maybe too many 😄). The downside to this open nature of the ecosystem is that it creates challenges for measurement and monetization as we’ll see in the rest of this article.</p><p> 发布者设置了播客播放器中的侦听器使用的公共RSS馈送URL，以订阅播客I.。播客播放器在发布时下载新剧集。当然，在现代，任何能力的播客应用程序索引最流行的播客，并为用户提供搜索功能，以发现播客而不是输入播客网址。注意此生态系统的美丽，因为本出版商 - 侦听器交易的两侧都是开放的。在发布商方面，播客馈送URL可公开可用，而无需任何理解Feed的XML结构的任何身份才能消耗。在听众方面，侦听器可以自由地使用他们最喜欢的播客播放器（有很多东西......也许太多了）。这种开放性的缺点是生态系统的缺点是它为测量和货币化创造了挑战，因为我们将在本文的其余部分中看到。 </p><p>  Spotify made it possible for anyone to pay $10 a month and have access to almost any song ever released! By doing so, Spotify might have single-handedly solved the piracy problem for the music industry and proved a business model exists where consumers will pay for music. Buoyed by Spotify’s success, major giants like Apple, Amazon &amp; Microsoft, and many others have tried to replicate Spotify’s strategy – albeit to varying degrees of success.</p><p>Spotify让任何人每月支付10美元，并且可以访问几乎所有易发放的歌曲！通过这样做，Spotify可能已经单枪匹集地解决了音乐行业的盗版问题，并证明了消费者支付音乐费用的商业模式。被Spotify的成功，主要巨人等苹果，亚马逊＆amp;微软和许多其他人试图复制Spotify的策略 - 尽管有不同程度的成功。</p><p>  Spotify has built an impressive business model in a crowded market despite being a late entrant in the music streaming business. Pandora, which once was the darling of the industry, has been continually losing users to Spotify. Pandora, which rose to prominence by helping users discover new music through its recommendation algorithm, was always marred by two fundamental limitations – limited catalog and a limited number of song skips due to licensing restrictions. In comparison, Spotify offered unlimited song skips and a bigger catalog in its free tier and was able to get many users to switch from Pandora. These free users would later go on to become Spotify’s paying users as Spotify delivered better value in its premium product and added restrictions on its free plan ( restricted song skips on mobile apps etc.) The chart below is evidence of what happened next. Pandora has been consistently losing users, while Spotify now almost has three times the number of Monthly-Active-Users (MAUs) as Pandora.</p><p>  Spotify在拥挤的市场中建立了一个令人印象深刻的商业模式，尽管音乐流媒体业务中的入参赛者。潘多拉是该行业的宠儿，一直是不断失去用户来发现。通过帮助用户通过其推荐算法来发现新音乐的潘多拉始终突出，始终受到两个基本限制的影响 - 由于许可限制，有限的目录和有限数量的歌曲跳过。相比之下，Spotify提供无限的歌曲跳过和一个更大的目录在其自由层中，并且能够让许多用户从Pandora切换。这些免费用户稍后将成为Spotify的支付用户，因为Spotify在其优质产品中提供了更好的价值，并在其自由计划（限制歌曲跳过移动应用程序上的限制歌曲等）的限制是下面的图表是接下来发生的事情的证据。 Pandora一直持续失去用户，而Spotify现在几乎有三次每月 - 活跃用户（MAU）作为潘多拉。</p><p> Today, Spotify is seeing increased growth quarter-over-quarter in both its ad-free and premium products with most of its revenue coming from its premium product.</p><p> 今天，Spotify看到其可广告和优质产品的增长季度增加，大部分收入来自其优质产品。</p><p>  2019 was a year that really set the foundations for Spotify’s podcast strategy. Spotify spent nearly $500 million in acquiring –  Anchor, Gimlet Media, and  Parcast/Cutler Media. Anchor, which bills itself as  “The easiest way to make a podcast”, supplies tools that make it easy for podcasters to create, distribute and monetize podcasts. Gimlet and Parcast, on the other hand, produce some of the most popular podcasts out there, such as StartUp, Reply All, Homecoming, Mogul, Serial Killers, Unsolved Murders, Cults and Conspiracy Theories and many more.</p><p>  2019年是一年，真正设定了Spotify的播客战略的基础。 Spotify花了近5亿美元的收购 - 锚，Gimlet媒体和公库/ Cutler媒体。锚点，将其作为“制作播客的最简单方法”，提供工具，使播放器轻松创建，分发和货币化播客。另一方面，Gimlet和Parcast，在那里产生一些最流行的播客，如启动，回复全部，家庭，大部分，串行杀手，未解决的谋杀，邪教和阴谋理论等等。</p><p> With these acquisitions, Spotify is pivoting into an “Audio” company – and no longer a music-only company. Here is what  Spotify CEO Daniel Ek had to say about these acquisitions in his essay titled “Audio-First”:</p><p> 通过这些收购，Spotify正在枢转入“音频”公司 - 并不再是一个唯一的音乐公司。以下是Spotify Ceo Daniel EK必须在他的论文中讨论“Audio-First”的这些收购：</p><p> That’s why we announced today the strategic acquisitions of two podcasting companies, Gimlet and Anchor. These companies serve two different, distinct roles in the industry. Gimlet is one of the best content creators in the world, with unique, celebrated podcast shows like  Homecoming, which was recently adapted into a critically acclaimed show on Amazon Prime, and the internet culture hit  Reply All. And Anchor has completely reimagined the path to audio creation, enabling creation for the next generation of podcasters worldwide – 15 billion hours of content on the platform during Q4. These companies are best-in-class, and together we will offer differentiated and original content. Gimlet and Anchor will position us to become the leading platform for podcast creators around the world and the leading producer of podcasts.</p><p> 这就是我们今天宣布的为什么两个播客公司，Gimly和Anchor的战略收购。这些公司在业内提供两种不同，不同的角色。 Gimly是世界上最好的内容创作者之一，与家庭竞争等竞争品牌相似，它最近在亚马逊素数上调整了一个批评的展示，互联网文化袭击了所有人。 Anchor完全重新称达了音频创建的路径，使全球的下一代播放机创建 - 在Q4期间平台上的150亿小时。这些公司始终如一，我们将在一起，我们将提供差异化​​和原创内容。 Gimless和Anchor将使我们成为世界各地播客创造者的领先平台和播客的领先生产商。</p><p> These acquisitions play in different parts of the podcast ecosystem but help Spotify cater to both sides of the podcast ecosystem – producers and listeners. Spotify believes it can extract value from the podcast ecosystem in a way no one has been able to do until now. An indicator of the importance of the podcast strategy to Spotify’s business can be judged by the number of mentions of the word “podcast” in its recent quarterly earnings releases.</p><p> 这些收购在播客生态系统的不同部分播放，但帮助发现迎合播客生态系统的两侧 - 生产者和听众。 Spotify认为它可以以播客生态系统提取价值，以便到现在没有人能够做到。播客策略对Spotify的业务的重要性的指标可以通过其最近的季度盈利发布中的“播客”一词的提升数量来判断。 </p><p> So far, 2020 is turning out to be another podcast investment year for Spotify. There’s a good reason why Spotify has spent close to a billion dollars on signing exclusive deals and buying podcast studios. From the  Q4 2019 quarterly report:</p><p>到目前为止，2020年被转出成为另一个播客对Spotify的投资年份。在签署独家交易和购买播客工作室，Spotify花费接近十亿美元的好理由。从2019年第四季度季度报告：</p><p> We continue to see exponential growth in podcast hours streamed (up approximately 200% Y/Y) and are now seeing clear indications that podcast usage is driving increased overall engagement and retention. We have seen early indications that our investments in podcasts are having a **positive impact on conversion of free to paid users.</p><p> 我们继续在流播播时间（上涨约200％Y / Y）的指数增长，现在看到明确的迹象表明播客使用促使促进的整体参与和保留。我们已经看到早期迹象表明，我们对播客的投资对转换为自由为付费用户的积极影响。</p><p>  For music listeners who do engage in podcasts, we are seeing increased engagement and increased conversion from Ad-Supported to Premium.  Some of the increases are extraordinary, almost too good to be true. We’re working to clean up the data to prove causality, not just correlation. **Still, our intuition is the data is more right than wrong, and that we’re onto something special.</p><p>  对于那些从事播客进行竞争的音乐听众，我们正在看到增加的参与和从广告支持的转换增加。一些增加是非凡的，几乎太好了。我们正在努力清理数据以证明因果关系，而不仅仅是相关性。 **仍然，我们的直觉是数据比错误更为正确，而且我们在特殊的东西。</p><p> With these investments, Spotify is aiming to add value, not just for the user but to its bottom-line as well. And it is clear that Spotify is having success that even it did not predict so soon.</p><p> 通过这些投资，Spotify旨在增加价值，而不仅仅是对用户而是底线。很明显，Spotify也取得了成功，即使它也没有预测。</p><p>  Spotify’s podcast strategy hinges on becoming an “Aggregator” of podcasts, as described in  Ben Thompson’s Aggregation Theory. Ben writes,</p><p>  Spotify的播客战略铰链成为播客的“聚集器”，如本汤普森的聚集理论所述。本写道，</p><p> The value chain for any given consumer market is divided into three parts: suppliers, distributors, and consumers/users. The best way to make outsize profits in any of these markets is to either gain a horizontal monopoly in one of the three parts or to integrate two of the parts such that you have a competitive advantage in delivering a vertical solution.</p><p> 任何给定的消费者市场的价值链分为三部分：供应商，分销商和消费者/用户。在这些市场中的任何一个中大放异的利润的最佳方法是在三个部分中的一个中获得水平垄断，也可以集成两个部件，使得您在提供垂直解决方案方面具有竞争优势。</p><p> Today, Spotify acts as the distributor of the audio content from suppliers i.e. the music labels  (Warner Music Group, Universal Music, Sony Music etc.) and podcast producers ( NPR, iHeartRadio, PRX, Wondery etc.). There are other distributors as well who are distributing the same content.</p><p> 今天，Spotify作为来自供应商的音频内容的经销商i.e.音乐标签（华纳音乐集团，普遍音乐，索尼音乐等）和播客生产商（NPR，Iheartradio，PRX，Wondery等）。还有其他经销商也正在分发相同的内容。 </p><p>  With the 2019 and 2020 investments, Spotify is beginning to differentiate itself from being just a podcast app and positioning itself as a supplier of podcasts.</p><p>通过2019年和2020年投资，Spotify开始区分自己只是一个播客应用程序，并将自己定位为播客的供应商。</p><p> Spotify will now be able to offer exclusive content on its platform. If this sounds like something you’ve heard before, then it is 😉 This is exactly what’s happening in the video streaming market with everyone looking to build their library of original content. I expect podcasts to be the next platform where platforms will compete on original content.</p><p> Spotify现在可以在其平台上提供专用内容。如果这听起来像是以前听过的那样，那么它就是😉这正是视频流市场中发生的事情，每个人都希望建立他们的原始内容库。我希望播客成为下一个平台，其中平台将竞争原始内容。</p><p> Besides offering exclusive content, Spotify’s building a platform where current podcasts that are published in the open model might become exclusive to Spotify for better monetization opportunities. These are what I call Spotify’s “Killer Features” and the topic of discussion in the next topic.</p><p> 除了提供独家内容外，Spotify建设一个平台，其中在开放模型中发布的当前播客可能是Spotify以获得更好的货币化机会。这些是我称之为Spotify的“杀手功能”以及下一个主题的讨论主题。</p><p>   The inertia of entrenched workflows is such that they are tough to change. Most users simply do not abandon an existing app to try out a shiny new app. I am often surprised at how many people do not take the time to explore all the knobs and dials in the settings of an app they use every day. Therefore, to get a user to adopt a new app, you need to offer significantly more value, and more importantly, that value needs to be observable with the default settings.</p><p>   根深蒂固的工作流的惯性使它们很难改变。大多数用户根本不会放弃现有的应用程序来试用闪亮的新应用程序。我常常感到惊讶，有多少人在每天使用的应用程序的设置中探索所有旋钮并拨打他们使用的设置。因此，要获取用户采用新应用程序，您需要提供更大的值，更重要的是，需要使用默认设置来观察该值。</p><p>  This has fundamentally changed the plane of competition: no longer do distributors compete based upon exclusive supplier relationships, with consumers/users an afterthought. Instead, suppliers can be commoditized leaving consumers/users as a first order priority. By extension, this means that the most important factor determining success is the user experience: the best distributors/aggregators/market-makers win by providing the best experience, which earns them the most consumers/users, which attracts the most suppliers, which enhances the user experience in a virtuous cycle.</p><p>  这从根本上改变了竞争飞机：不再是经销商基于独家供应商的关系竞争，消费者/用户成为事后的经文。相反，供应商可以将消费者/用户作为一阶优先级。通过扩展，这意味着最重要的决定成功的因素是用户体验：通过提供最佳体验，最佳分销商/聚合者/市场制造商获胜，这为他们吸引最多的供应商而获得最佳消费者/用户用户在良性周期中的体验。</p><p> This essentially means that Spotify needs to offer both Suppliers and Consumers a much better user experience for Spotify to become the platform of choice. Otherwise, users will continue to listen in their existing podcast apps. On the other hand, publishers have no incentive to publish exclusively on Spotify’s platform. At a high-level Spotify’s will provide the following benefits to both suppliers and consumers:</p><p> 这基本上意味着Spotify需要提供供应商和消费者提供更好的用户体验，以成为选择的平台。否则，用户将继续在其现有的播客应用中倾听。另一方面，出版商没有激励在Spotify的平台上公布。在高级别的Spotify中，将为供应商和消费者提供以下好处：</p><p>   Today, a user discovers the podcast title on their own through the internet, friends, family, etc. This model is remarkably like how consumers used to discover music. This model worked fine when there were few good podcasts, but with the explosion of new material on the podcast scene, finding enjoyable content is becoming akin to finding a needle in a haystack.</p><p>   今天，用户通过互联网，朋友，家庭等自己发现播客标题。此模型非常喜欢消费者如何发现音乐。当播客很多播客时，这种模型很好，但随着播客场景的新材料爆炸，发现令人愉快的内容正在逐渐成为在干草堆中寻找针。 </p><p>   Today, new music discovery is primarily done through algorithmic recommendations that are based on demographics, genre, mood, similarity, etc. Spotify is no stranger to this model, having transformed music discovery with playlists like  Discover Weekly and  Daily Mix. Now, Spotify introducing a similar model to podcast consumption and discovery.</p><p>今天，新的音乐发现主要是通过基于人口统计数据，类型，情绪，相似性等的算法建议进行。Spotify对此模型没有陌生人，与播放列表进行了转换的音乐发现，如每周和每日混合。现在，Spotify将类似的模型引入播客消费和发现。</p><p>  First, Spotify recently introduced podcast playlists such as  Daily Podcasts, Editorial playlists –  Best Podcasts of the Week, Crime Scene, and Brain Snacks and to help with the pandemic blues –  Daily Wellness. Here’s an example from Spotify of how Daily Podcasts playlist makes podcast discovery easier:</p><p>  首先，Spotify最近引入了播客播放列表，如日常播客，编辑播放列表 - 本周的最佳播客，犯罪现场和大脑零食，并帮助大流行蓝调 - 日常健康。以下是Spotify日常播客播放列表如何使播客发现更轻松：</p><p> Then, based on your listening history and the podcast type, we’ll recommend the next best episodes for you.</p><p> 然后，根据您的聆听历史和播客类型，我们将为您推荐下一个最佳剧集。</p><p> That might be the next sequential episode in a podcast you’re already listening to (think  Dog Tales and  How’s Work with Esther Perel), a recent stand-alone evergreen episode in another show (maybe  Amy Schumer Presents: 3 Girls 1 Keith or  Certified Buckets), or a timely episode from a daily updating podcast (like  Horoscope Today or  The Journal).</p><p> 这可能是你已经听过的播客中的下一个顺序发作（思考狗的故事以及如何与Esther Perel的工作方式），另一个展示中最近独立的常绿集演（可能是Amy Schumer礼物：3个女孩1 Keith或认证铲斗），或者从每日更新播客（如今天的星座或期刊）的及时剧集。</p><p> Don’t worry – no spoilers here! If you’ve never listened to a story-driven sequential show we think you’d like, you’ll get the trailer or pilot episode first – to see if it catches your eye (er, ear).</p><p> 别担心 - 这里没有扰流板！如果你从未听过故事驱动的顺序展示我们认为你想要的，你将获得预告片或试点第一次 - 看看它是否抓住了你的眼睛（呃，耳朵）。</p><p> The importance of these editorial playlists cannot be understated.  As Steve Benjamins’s experience proves that being included in the  “Discover Weekly” playlist is the primary reason for his $800 per month income. Steve writes:</p><p> 这些编辑播放列表的重要性无法低估。由于史蒂夫本杰明的经验证明，被列入“发现每周”播放列表是每月800美元的主要原因。史蒂夫写道：</p><p> Every Monday my music gets a spike in streams on Spotify. You could set a watch to it – it’s that consistent.</p><p> 每个星期一我的音乐都在Spotify上获得了溪流的尖峰。你可以向它设置一张手表 - 这是一致的。 </p><p>  Well every Monday Spotify sends out a new Discover Weekly playlist. Discover Weekly is an algorithmic playlist – which means its personalized with songs Spotify thinks the user would like.</p><p>每个星期一Spotify都会发出新的发现每周播放列表。发现每周是一个算法播放列表 - 这意味着它的个性化与Spotify认为用户想要的思考。</p><p> No other promotional tactic in music comes close to Discover Weekly in delivering new listeners in such a low-effort, high volume way.</p><p> 在音乐中没有其他促销策略接近，以便在每周以这种低努力，高批量方式提供新的听众。</p><p> Back in 2013 I would spend hours cold-emailing bloggers. I would be lucky if I got a hit and got 1,000 plays on one of my songs. It was labor intensive.</p><p> 回到2013年，我会花费几个小时的冷电子邮件博主。如果我被击中，我会很幸运，我的一首歌有1,000首歌曲。它是劳动密集型的。</p><p> Now algorithmic playlists like Discover Weekly send 1,000 new listeners every week without any work on my part. This is amazing. Cold outreach sucks. It sucks for the artist and it sucks for the bloggers. Spotify deserves a lot of credit for here.</p><p> 现在，算法播放列表，如每周发现每周发送1,000名新侦听器，而不在我的部队工作。这真太了不起了。冷外徒吮吸。它糟透了艺术家，它糟透了博主。 Spotify值得在这里获得很多信誉。</p><p> Second, Spotify is borrowing a leaf out of Netflix’s recommendations strategy. Like  Netflix Prize before it, which aimed at making Netflix’s recommendation engine more accurate, Spotify announced the  “Spotify Podcast Dataset and TREC Challenge”. This dataset holds raw audio and transcripts of 100,000 episodes from thousands of different shows on Spotify. With this research challenge, Spotify is trying to understand the content of podcasts (e.g. what exactly is being covered, by whom, and how?) and, and how to use this information to connect users to shows that align with their interests. This data will help answers questions such as:</p><p> 其次，Spotify借用Netflix的建议策略借用叶子。像Netflix奖它一样，它旨在使Netflix的推荐引擎更加准确，Spotify宣布“Spotify Podcast DataSet和TREC挑战”。此数据集保存了Spotify的数千个不同节目的100,000剧集的原始音频和成绩单。通过这项研究挑战，Spotify正试图了解播客的内容（例如，究竟是什么是由谁覆盖，谁以及如何？）以及如何使用此信息来连接用户以其兴趣将其显示对齐。此数据将有助于回答问题：</p><p> How to identify podcasts that interview Barack Obama, as opposed to those that talk about him?</p><p> 如何识别采访巴拉克奥巴马的播客，而不是那些谈论他的人？</p><p>  Which podcasts are “high quality” or “informative” or “interesting”?</p><p>  哪些播客是“高质量”或“信息性”或“有趣”？ </p><p> With these answers, Spotify will be able to recommend better not just shows but a segment within a specific episode that might align with your interests. These recommendations have the potential to change podcast consumption forever and build a moat for Spotify, which will be hard to overcome or replicate.</p><p>通过这些答案，Spotify将能够更好地推荐，而是可以在特定集中显示一个可以与您的兴趣保持一致的细分。这些建议有可能永远改变播客消费，并为Spotify构建一个Moat，这将难以克服或复制。</p><p>  Spotify recommendation engine can suggest podcasts or even episodes that might be related to your existing subscriptions</p><p>  Spotify推荐引擎可以建议播客或甚至可能与现有订阅相关的剧集</p><p>  Reporting and measurement of listener demographics are not easy due to the decentralized podcast distribution model through RSS feeds. The podcast feed publishing system acts as a dumb 1-way delivery pipe to the user’s podcast player of choice. This has made publishers produce creative strategies such as audience surveys, coupon codes, vanity URLs, etc. to derive proxy metrics for ad impressions, audience segments, etc.</p><p>  通过RSS馈送的分散播客模型，倾听者人口统计学的报告和测量并不容易。播客饲料出版系统充当用户播客选择的哑递1路交付管道。这使得出版商产生创造性的策略，如受众调查，优惠券代码，虚荣URL等，以获得广告印象，观众段等的代理指标。</p><p> To solve this problem, Spotify launched the  “Spotify for Podcasters” dashboard. Here is an excerpt from the  launch blog post:</p><p> 要解决此问题，Spotify推出了“Spotify for Podcaster”仪表板。以下是发布博客文章的摘录：</p><p> At its core, Spotify for Podcasters is a discovery and analytics dashboard. One where you can both submit your show to Spotify and dive deep into engagement and demographic data for your podcast, tracking things like average listening times, episode streams, and total listeners. With so many podcasts out there, it’s more important than ever that you have the data you need to help you understand and grow your audience. That’s exactly what your dashboard is designed to provide.</p><p> 在其核心，Spotify for Podcaster是一个发现和分析仪表板。您可以在其中提交节目以发现和潜入播客的参与和人口统计数据，跟踪平均聆听时间，剧集流和总侦听器。在那里有这么多播客，它比以往任何时候都更重要，您可以帮助您了解和发展您的受众所需的数据。这正是您的仪表板旨在提供的内容。</p><p>  Spotify has already done the hard work of building the tools for tracking music engagement. Therefore, it is only natural that those same tools can be extended to podcast publishers. “Spotify for Podcasters” dashboard is designed to provide these analytics and engagement tracking tools for publishers to track what kind of content resonates with their listeners and adjust.</p><p>  Spotify已经完成了构建用于跟踪音乐参与的工具的努力。因此，只能将相同的工具扩展到播客发布者是自然的。 “Spotify for Podcasters”仪表板旨在为发布商提供这些分析和订婚跟踪工具，以跟踪与其侦听器的内容共振的内容并进行调整。</p><p>  While other digital mediums such as online retail and social media have figured out advertising models, podcast monetization remains a tough challenge for publishers. To sell ad spots, a publisher needs to build relationships with brands and provide podcast consumption metrics and listener demographics. In the podcast ecosystem, these metrics and listener demographics are not easily discoverable as I described in the last section and how Spotify will add value in this area.  Spotify compares the current state of advertising in the podcast ecosystem to that in the print medium.</p><p>  虽然其他数字媒介，如在线零售和社交媒体，但播放模型，播客货币化仍然是出版商的艰难挑战。要销售广告点，发布商需要与品牌建立关系，并提供播客消费指标和侦听器人口统计数据。在播客生态系统中，这些度量标准和侦听器人口统计数据不容易被发现，因为我在最后一节中描述以及Spotify如何在该区域增加值。 Spotify比较了播客生态系统中的广告的当前状态，以在打印介质中。 </p><p> “…the podcast industry measures audience, reach, and impact much like you would a full-page ad in a magazine. Advertisers generally have a sense for who they’re reaching, based on survey data and the magazine’s target audience. Total circulation measures the number of doorsteps that the issue hits, but there’s no precise data on how many readers actually opened the magazine, let alone reached or acted on the ad.”</p><p>“......播客行业衡量观众，达到和影响，就像你在杂志中的全面广告一样。广告商通常根据调查数据和杂志的目标受众对谁达到谁。总流通措施衡量问题命中的门口的数量，但是有关多少读者实际打开杂志的情况下没有精确的数据，更不用说达到或采取行动。“</p><p> Spotify is in a unique position to solve these challenges because it has more personalized data on its users than any of the podcast apps. More importantly, it has already built this kind of targeted ad technology to monetize its free music users. Spotify has launched two key features to enable podcast monetization.</p><p> Spotify是一个独特的地位来解决这些挑战，因为它与任何播客应用程序都有更多个性化数据。更重要的是，它已经建立了这种有针对性的广告技术，可以将其免费音乐用户批准。 Spotify推出了两个关键功能，以实现播客货币化。</p><p> First, Spotify launched  Streaming Ad Insertion (SAI) technology to dynamically insert ads into user’s podcast streams based on what it knows about the user, like where they are located, type of device they use, age, etc. Spotify posits that SAI can  &#34; offer intimacy and quality of traditional podcast ads with the precision and transparency of modern-day digital marketing.&#34; So instead of your favorite podcast host talking through the benefits of a product that might be irrelevant to you, you might hear a more personalized ad based on your listening habits and interests, which might be good or bad depending on your take on advertisements.</p><p> 首先，Spoteify启动流广告插入（SAI）技术基于它对用户的了解，如它们所在的信息，使用它们使用的设备类型，年龄等，Spotiets PoSiets＆ ＃34;提供传统播客广告的亲密度和质量，具有现代数字营销的精度和透明度。＆＃34;因此，而不是您最喜欢的播客主机通过可能与您无关的产品的好处，您可以根据您的聆听习惯和兴趣来听取更个性化的广告，这可能取决于您的广告。</p><p>  Spotify’s podcast streaming model also helps as the ads can be inserted dynamically into the podcast stream instead of being pre-baked into the downloaded audio file. With SAI, Spotify offers the easiest way to monetize podcasts for creators – very YouTube-like. Theoretically, in the future, a publisher could just tick a checkbox saying they want to opt their podcast into ads, and Spotify would take care of everything – ad bidding, ad insertions, etc. It’s conceivable that the Spotify could even allow publishers to replace the generic ads with more targeted ones and receive a higher payout compared to advertising on other platforms. In the end, you’d have the same podcast stream with generic ads in the podcast apps that download the podcast and targeted ads in the Spotify stream.</p><p>  Spotify的播客流程模型也有助于，因为广告可以动态插入到播客流中，而不是将预先烘焙到下载的音频文件中。与Sai，Spotify提供了最简单的方法来为创造者批准播客 - 非常youtube。理论上，将来，出版商可以勾选一个复选框，称他们要将他们的播客选择到广告中，并且Spotify将照顾所有 - 广告竞标，广告插入等。它可以想到，Spotify甚至可以允许出版商替换出版商与其他平台上的广告相比，具有更具目标的通用广告并获得更高的支付。最后，您将在Podcast应用程序中具有相同的播客流，在Spotify Stream中下载播客和目标广告。</p><p>  Second, Spotify is launching  In-App Offers. Podcast listening usually happens in parallel with </p><p>  其次，Spotify正在启动应用程序提供。播客聆听通常与之并行发生</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://singhkays.com/blog/how-spotify-is-killing-the-open-podcast-ecosystem/">https://singhkays.com/blog/how-spotify-is-killing-the-open-podcast-ecosystem/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/播客/">#播客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/2020/">#2020</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/killing/">#killing</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
