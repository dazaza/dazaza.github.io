Is GraphQL the answer to your API woes? Should you follow the latest DevOps playbook to increase your system reliability? In the world of tech tools, there’s a lot of buzz. But it doesn’t always reflect the daily reality of programmers.</p><p>你应该搬到无服务器吗？GraphQL是解决API问题的答案吗？您是否应该遵循最新的DevOps手册来提高系统可靠性？在科技工具的世界里，有很多嗡嗡声。但它并不总是反映程序员的日常现实。</p><p> As the founder of a developer tools startup, I’ve talked with hundreds, if not thousands, of software developers over the last few years in the course of routine user research. The common theme in these conversations, even bigger than the need for the product we were building, was an overarching need that is currently underserved: building for   real developers , or what I like to call the  99% Developers .</p><p>作为一家开发工具初创公司的创始人，我在过去几年的常规用户研究过程中与数百名（如果不是数千名的话）软件开发人员进行了交谈。这些对话中的共同主题，甚至比我们正在构建的产品的需求更大，是一个目前未得到充分服务的总体需求：为真正的开发者构建，或者我喜欢称之为99%的开发者。</p><p> These are developers who are getting work done outside of the hip companies and frameworks, who often get neglected in conversations about “what developers want.” There’s a   huge  gap between what “developer-influencers” are talking about, and the daily reality of most developers. When you look at what gets covered by the tech media, or the speakers at top tech conferences, it’s often people from high-growth darlings like Airbnb or Stripe, or established, highly profitable companies like the FAANGs.</p><p>这些是在热门公司和框架之外完成工作的开发人员，他们在关于“开发人员想要什么”的对话中经常被忽视“开发者影响者”谈论的内容与大多数开发者的日常现实之间存在巨大差距。当你看到科技媒体或顶级科技会议上的演讲者报道的内容时，往往是来自Airbnb或Stripe等高增长宠儿的人，或FAANGs等老牌高利润公司的人。</p><p> In fact, there’s a longstanding assumption that companies, outside of a small number of Silicon Valley unicorns, should aspire to have the processes of a “baby FAANG.” But this is increasingly not true. Our users would tell us, often sheepishly, that their practices look nothing like what they are “supposed to.” But for these “dark matter developers,” as   Microsoft’s Scott Hanselman calls them , the practices of a Facebook or a Pinterest don’t make sense. Their user needs are different and their team needs are different.</p><p>事实上，长期以来，人们一直认为，除了少数硅谷独角兽之外，企业应该渴望拥有“婴儿FAANG”的流程但这一点越来越不正确。我们的用户往往会不好意思地告诉我们，他们的做法与他们“应该”的完全不同但对于这些微软的斯科特·汉斯曼（Scott Hanselman）所称的“暗物质开发者”，Facebook或Pinterest的做法毫无意义。他们的用户需求不同，团队需求也不同。</p><p> It matters to talk about the 99% Developers because these are the developers building the software that powers our lives — insurance, health care, retail, and banking, just to name a few. It’s not only small companies that can’t easily adopt the processes of modern, tech-first companies; it’s most companies that were not built around technology and that have decades of legacy software practices firmly in place. Many of these companies move around quite a bit of money. Many of these companies handle quite a bit of our personal data. If technology innovations are not benefiting these software teams, we’re losing out on a lot of meaningful improvements to everyone’s quality of life.</p><p>谈论99%的开发人员很重要，因为这些开发人员正在开发为我们的生命提供动力的软件——保险、医疗保健、零售和银行，仅举几例。不仅是小公司不能轻易采用现代科技领先公司的流程；大多数公司都不是围绕着技术而建立的，它们有几十年的遗留软件实践。这些公司中的很多都会转移大量资金。这些公司中的许多都处理我们相当多的个人数据。如果技术创新没有让这些软件团队受益，我们就失去了对每个人的生活质量的许多有意义的改善。</p><p> In this piece, I’ll present some truths that both enterprise software buyers and builders can embrace to dispel harmful myths and improve developer experience for all.</p><p>在这篇文章中，我将介绍一些企业软件购买者和建设者都可以接受的真理，以消除有害的神话，并改善所有开发者的体验。</p><p>   Because a disproportionate amount of writing and tooling comes from companies like Facebook, Netflix, LinkedIn, Google, and Amazon, many people assume there’s a trickle-down effect: Great engineers at companies with money to burn come up with good solutions to problems everyone else will have someday. It’s simply a matter of time until your typical small-to-medium business or Fortune 500 company experiences the same issues as Amazon or Facebook.</p><p>由于Facebook、Netflix、LinkedIn、谷歌和亚马逊等公司提供了大量的写作和工具，许多人认为这是一种涓滴效应：有钱的公司的伟大工程师会想出好的解决方案，解决其他人有朝一日会遇到的问题。你典型的中小型企业或财富500强公司遇到与亚马逊或Facebook相同的问题只是时间问题。</p><p>  A FAANG-like company is different from an SMB or your typical Fortune 500 company along many dimensions, including scale needs, stance on building vs. buying, and makeup of the engineering team. A small number of large, well-capitalized companies have entire teams with world experts dedicated to observability, testing, developer productivity, and more. On top of this, it’s worth noting that FAANGs are optimizing around a small set of products that are digital from the start, something that’s not true of most software shops out there.</p><p>类似FAANG的公司在很多方面都不同于SMB或典型的财富500强公司，包括规模需求、建筑与购买的立场，以及工程团队的组成。少数资本雄厚的大型公司拥有全世界专家组成的团队，致力于可观察性、测试、开发人员生产率等方面的工作。除此之外，值得注意的是，FAANG正在围绕一小部分从一开始就数字化的产品进行优化，这在大多数软件商店中是不正确的。</p><p> Many non-FAANG teams have a small non-expert team, or even a fraction of a non-expert engineer, to do things that FAANG-like companies have multiple teams of experts to do. These organizations rely primarily on external tools and services that they have little bandwidth for customizing.</p><p>许多非FAANG团队都有一个小型的非专家团队，甚至是非专家工程师的一小部分，来做FAANG类公司有多个专家团队要做的事情。这些组织主要依赖外部工具和服务，它们几乎没有用于定制的带宽。</p><p>  First, the tech industry needs to acknowledge that organizations operating at different scales and with different engineering budgets are going to have different needs. A company that serves in the low millions of user requests per day doesn’t need to optimize its systems to the degree of a Netflix or a Google. Most companies do not have the latency, data storage, and other concerns that would lead them to write their own bespoke infrastructure components and tools like, for example, Facebook did with its   Tao data store  and   Hive data warehousing tool  — and they likely don’t have concerns that would warrant them even using such tools.</p><p>首先，科技行业需要认识到，不同规模、不同工程预算的组织将有不同的需求。一家每天处理数百万用户请求的公司不需要像Netflix或谷歌那样优化其系统。大多数公司没有延迟、数据存储和其他问题导致他们编写自己的定制基础设施组件和工具，比如Facebook使用其Tao data store和Hive data warehousing工具所做的事情——而且他们可能没有任何问题可以保证他们使用这些工具。</p><p> Acknowledging different demands will make space to talk about diverse needs across a wide range of organizations. For instance, companies with legacy systems that can’t afford to migrate to the newest architectures need to adopt new tools differently than newer companies, or companies that can dedicate a team to a large migration.</p><p>承认不同的需求将为讨论各种组织的不同需求提供空间。例如，那些遗留系统无法迁移到最新体系结构的公司需要采用不同于较新公司的新工具，或者那些可以专门组建团队进行大规模迁移的公司。</p><p> Recognizing that there isn’t a single aspirational company profile can help builders reach outside of the usual suspects when understanding users. This is crucial for bridging the gap between software needs and software tools in an achievable way.</p><p>认识到没有一个理想的公司简介可以帮助建设者在理解用户时超越通常的怀疑。这对于以可实现的方式弥合软件需求和软件工具之间的差距至关重要。</p><p> Spot on by  @jeanqasaur. Eg big tech invests big time in internal platform teams that are rarely present elsewhere.</p><p>现场由@jeanqasaur报道。例如，big tech在其他地方很少出现的内部平台团队中投入大量时间。</p><p> Example: at Uber the mobile platform team identified slow-running tests *that my team wrote/owned* &amp; pinged us on how we should fix it.</p><p>例如：在优步，移动平台团队发现了我的团队编写/拥有的运行缓慢的测试*&amp；告诉我们该怎么修。</p><p>    If you watch enough conference talks or read enough blog posts, it would appear there are many software teams out there with pristine coding standards, non-flaky unit tests, staging environments that reflect production environments, and/or smooth people processes for responding to incidents. Getting to this point just requires a strong directive from above and discipline across engineering teams.</p><p>如果你看了足够多的会议演讲或阅读了足够多的博客文章，就会发现有许多软件团队采用了原始的编码标准、非脆弱的单元测试、反映生产环境的临时环境，和/或平滑的人员流程来应对事故。要做到这一点，只需要上级的强烈指示和整个工程团队的纪律。</p><p>  Just like influencers in any other field, developer-influencers often describe a reality that is aspirational even for their own companies. It may be true that people writing about ideal processes live in an idealized situation where it’s possible, in which case they’re the exception that provides the rule. But most of the time — even if it’s true in one part of an organization or at one moment in time — this reality does not hold across their entire company and forever more.</p><p>就像其他领域的影响者一样，开发者影响者经常描述一个现实，即使对他们自己的公司来说也是令人向往的。写理想过程的人可能生活在一个理想化的环境中，在这种情况下，他们是提供规则的例外。但大多数时候——即使在一个组织的某个部分或某个时刻是真的——这种现实并不适用于他们的整个公司，也不会永远适用。</p><p> For instance, Spotify admitted that   their lionized approach to DevOps did not scale once their team reached a certain size . We also see examples of companies adopting the new hot technology and then reverting when things didn’t work as well as planned — for instance,   Segment switching from microservices back to a monolith .</p><p>例如，Spotify承认，一旦他们的团队达到一定规模，他们对DevOps的崇拜方式就无法扩大规模。我们还看到一些公司采用了新的热门技术，然后在事情没有按计划进行时恢复——例如，细分市场从微服务转向整体服务。</p><p>  As the audience powering all of this, developers should be more critical in asking for the truth. We should welcome posts about “real software process” as much as we are hungry for the idealized content. If someone is working in an idealized process, with a world-class ops team and whole teams of people who exist to support improved software quality, the audience should be made aware of this! And we should welcome more talks, blog posts, and books that give guidance for “real software environments”: what coding, testing, and shipping looks like with short-staffed teams, teams without dedicated devops experts, and teams where everyone who originally built the system has left.</p><p>当观众为这一切提供动力时，开发人员在询问真相时应该更加挑剔。我们应该欢迎关于“真实软件过程”的帖子，就像我们渴望理想化的内容一样。如果有人在一个理想化的过程中工作，有一个世界级的ops团队和一整支支持改进软件质量的团队，那么观众应该意识到这一点！我们应该欢迎更多为“真正的软件环境”提供指导的讲座、博客帖子和书籍：在人员短缺的团队、没有专门的devops专家的团队以及最初构建系统的所有人都离开的团队中，编码、测试和发布是什么样子的。</p><p> Another little secret: a lot of what most “developer influencers” say is fairly aspirational.</p><p>另一个小秘密是：大多数“开发者影响者”说的很多话都是相当有抱负的。</p><p> Their own companies don’t necessarily do things as smoothly as they preach to others.</p><p>他们自己的公司做事情不一定像他们对别人说教那样顺利。</p><p> This is especially true at larger companies where the culture might vary vastly between orgs/teams  https://t.co/FW2aI8lppu</p><p>这在大型公司尤其如此，在这些公司中，组织/团队之间的文化差异可能很大https://t.co/FW2aI8lppu</p><p>    Too many people believe that aiming for good software quality means you need to fully adopt that new technology, whether it’s microservices, GraphQL, or distributed tracing. You’re not done until you’ve switched fully over to the ideal technology.</p><p>太多人认为，追求良好的软件质量意味着你需要完全采用这种新技术，无论是微服务、GraphQL还是分布式跟踪。在完全切换到理想技术之前，您还没有完成。</p><p>  Today, the mismatch between where “real developer” teams are and the mainstream advice given out means that many teams don’t know where to start when it comes to improving code quality or system reliability. For the 99% Developer, most of their code will never need to scale to an organization of thousands, or to billions of users. Many of these developers work on code bases older than the length of their entire careers. Most of these organizations don’t have dedicated developer tools or developer-productivity teams internally.</p><p>如今，“真正的开发人员”团队的位置与给出的主流建议之间的不匹配意味着，在提高代码质量或系统可靠性方面，许多团队不知道从哪里开始。对于99%的开发人员来说，他们的大部分代码永远不需要扩展到数千人或数十亿用户的组织。这些开发人员中的许多人的代码基础比他们整个职业生涯都要老。这些组织中的大多数在内部没有专门的开发人员工具或开发人员生产力团队。</p><p> Pristine code is not the goal — rather, the goal is code that is as reliable and secure as it makes sense to be, given other constraints. For instance, if your company does not operate across multiple clouds deploying hundreds of changes a day, a continuous delivery system like Netflix’s   Spinnaker  is likely unnecessary. Similarly, developers at a company with devops experts who know how to set up and maintain observability “power tools” will likely have a much better time with those tools than a company without an expert team in place.</p><p>原始代码不是目标——相反，目标是在其他约束条件下，尽可能可靠和安全的代码。例如，如果您的公司没有跨多个云运营，每天部署数百个更改，那么像Netflix的Spinnaker这样的连续交付系统可能是不必要的。类似地，与没有专家团队的公司相比，拥有devops专家、知道如何设置和维护可观察性“电动工具”的公司的开发人员使用这些工具的时间可能会更好。</p><p>  Recognize that there is progress to be made — there are lessons to be learned from companies that have devoted entire teams to perfecting their processes — but perfection in most cases is unrealistic. Rather than lifting processes wholesale, see which ones translate well to teams with fewer resources and teams with different goals.</p><p>认识到需要取得进展——从那些投入整个团队来完善流程的公司那里可以吸取教训——但在大多数情况下，完善是不现实的。与其全盘取消流程，不如看看哪些流程适合资源较少的团队和目标不同的团队。</p><p> For instance,   this Google blog post  provides the guideline of 60% test coverage as “acceptable,” 75% as “commendable,” and 90% as “exemplary.” When you’re a company of Google’s maturity, with the size and caliber of Google’s engineering team, this may make sense. But for most smaller, earlier-stage companies, the actual test coverage is going to be far less despite what the company might aim for. And with the rise of service-oriented architectures and external APIs — practices that are much more prevalent outside of Google —   testing in production  is becoming a viable alternative to the traditional unit- and integration-testing techniques where “code coverage” makes sense as a concept.</p><p>例如，这篇谷歌博客文章提供了60%的测试覆盖率为“可接受”，75%为“值得称赞”，90%为“模范”的指导原则如果你是一家像谷歌那样成熟的公司，拥有谷歌工程团队的规模和才干，这可能是有道理的。但对于大多数规模较小、处于早期阶段的公司来说，不管公司的目标是什么，实际的测试覆盖率都会低得多。随着面向服务的体系结构和外部API（在谷歌之外更为普遍的做法）的兴起，生产测试正在成为传统单元测试和集成测试技术的可行替代方案，在这些技术中，“代码覆盖”作为一个概念是有意义的。</p><p> In many of these modern systems, as   Honeycomb co-founder Charity Majors wrote , “Once you deploy, you aren’t testing code anymore, you’re testing systems — complex systems made up of users, code, environment, infrastructure, and a point in time.”</p><p>在许多现代系统中，正如蜂巢联合创始人Charity Majors所写，“一旦部署，就不再测试代码，而是测试系统——由用户、代码、环境、基础设施和时间点组成的复杂系统。”</p><p>   It’s too easy to fall into the trap of assuming that demos and onboarding are indicative of the experience of using a product day in and day out. People have to make buying decisions about new products relatively quickly, so we’ve defaulted to judging a product by its demo.</p><p>人们很容易陷入这样一个陷阱：假设演示和上线都是日复一日使用产品的体验的象征。人们必须相对快速地做出购买新产品的决定，因此我们默认根据产品的演示来判断产品。</p><p>  Developer tool empires are built through slick gifs and video clips. Teams commit to tools — sometimes for years — after a few minutes of demo. Investors invest based on demos. Builders are told to focus on the demo — and, after that, the first 60 seconds of use — as the make-or-break parts of the product. But while being able to execute well on a demo   might  suggest that the team   can  execute on developer experience in day-to-day use, the two aren’t necessarily correlated.</p><p>开发者工具帝国是通过巧妙的GIF和视频剪辑建立起来的。在几分钟的演示之后，团队会致力于开发工具——有时会持续数年。投资者根据演示进行投资。建设者被告知要把重点放在演示上——以及在演示之后的前60秒使用——作为产品的成败部分。但是，虽然能够在演示中很好地执行可能意味着团队可以在日常使用中执行开发人员体验，但这两者并不一定相关。</p><p> It should not be a surprise that with most tools worth their price tags, most of what a developer experiences — and experiences pain around — occurs outside of the first minute of use. First, integrations with developers’ day-to-day-workflows (for instance, existing code review, CI/CD workflows, and modes of collaboration) is a better indicator of whether a product will be sticky than are initial delighters. It’s well-known among developer tools creators, for example, that integrating with GitHub and GitLab will help make your tool much more useful and appealing.</p><p>对于大多数值得付出代价的工具来说，开发人员经历的大部分事情——以及经历的痛苦——都发生在使用的第一分钟之外，这并不奇怪。首先，与开发人员的日常工作流程（例如，现有的代码审查、CI/CD工作流程和协作模式）的集成，是一个更好的指标，表明一个产品是否会比最初的产品更具粘性。例如，开发人员工具的创造者们都知道，与GitHub和GitLab的集成将有助于使您的工具更加有用和吸引人。</p><p> Second, there are whole classes of tools where the true test of their effectiveness doesn’t happen on Day 1. One example is debuggers. More than your development environment and more than your CI/CD environment, your debugging toolbox is the most crucial factor to your quality of life as a developer. When you fix an issue before you deploy, are you confident that the issue won’t appear in production? When you have to work late or on a day off because of a production incident, are you able to quickly identify the root cause and come up with potential fixes? Because of the complexity of these tools — and because they often don’t show their true colors until you   have  a major issue — debugging tools often get the least hype and the least reward for good developer experience.</p><p>第二，有很多种类的工具，它们的有效性的真正测试不会在第一天进行。调试器就是一个例子。调试工具箱不仅是开发环境，而且是CI/CD环境，它是影响开发人员生活质量的最关键因素。当您在部署前解决问题时，您确信该问题不会出现在生产中吗？当你因为生产事故不得不加班或休息一天时，你是否能够快速找出根本原因并提出潜在的解决方案？由于这些工具的复杂性——并且因为它们通常在出现重大问题之前不会显示出它们的本来面目——调试工具通常会因为良好的开发人员体验而得到最少的宣传和回报。</p><p>  The reason tool builders often disproportionately focus on the Day 1 experience is because of how users evaluate tools. So I’m going to give a special callout to users here. Users need to:</p><p>工具建设者往往不成比例地关注第一天的体验，这是因为用户如何评估工具。所以我要给这里的用户一个特别的提示。用户需要：</p><p> Push back on tools that get you to commit to big contracts before you or your developer team have spent time working with the tool day in and day out for some period of time.</p><p>在你或你的开发团队花时间日复一日地使用工具一段时间之前，不要使用那些让你承诺签订大型合同的工具。</p><p> Recommend tools to other people based on the less “sexy” dimensions that are key to your team’s productivity, such as how they integrate with workflows, or how they reduce collaboration friction within and across teams.</p><p>根据对团队生产力至关重要的不那么“性感”的维度向其他人推荐工具，例如它们如何与工作流集成，或者它们如何减少团队内部和团队之间的协作摩擦。</p><p>    There’s often the assumption that the hot new language or framework is all that exists in someone’s system. Developers and developer-influencers alike will evangelize new tools as if those are the   only  tools being used: for instance, microservice architectures, GraphQL, and OpenTelemetry-based tracing for observability. “One true framework” evangelism implicitly assumes that it’s possible for organizations to switch over to using entirely that new language, tool, or framework.</p><p>人们通常认为，热门的新语言或框架就是某人系统中存在的全部。开发者和开发者影响者都会宣传新的工具，就好像它们是唯一被使用的工具一样：例如，微服务架构、GraphQL和基于OpenTelemetry的可观察性跟踪。“一个真正的框架”布道隐含地假设，组织有可能转向使用全新的语言、工具或框架。</p><p>  I’ve encountered so many teams who say that migration will happen “next quarter.” The reality is that, even when they manage to finally start, migrations have become continuous, rather than discrete, processes. A 99% Developer team with legacy code and a lean team is probably never going to convert their entire code base over to microservices or GraphQL. For most organizations, tech stacks and tool chains are heterogeneous,  a combination of the layers of languages, frameworks, and tools that have been picked up over the years.</p><p>我遇到过很多团队，他们说迁移将在“下一季度”进行现实情况是，即使迁移最终成功开始，迁移也已经变成了连续的过程，而不是离散的过程。一个拥有99%遗留代码的开发团队和一个精干的团队可能永远不会将他们的整个代码库转换为微服务或GraphQL。对于大多数组织来说，技术堆栈和工具链是异构的，是多年来逐渐形成的语言、框架和工具层的组合。</p><p> Many of the teams we encounter will tell us that they’re starting to adopt microservices or GraphQL or OpenTelemetry. When I ask them how much of their services are within the new framework already, the answer will often be quite small, especially for organizations older than a few years. Some of these organizations will tell me that they realistically don’t expect to convert their entire code base. (For example, organizations will expect to maintain their legacy monolith alongside microservices, or REST and gRPC endpoints along with GraphQL endpoints.) For many other organizations, when I check some quarters later, they are often less far along in the planned migration than expected — and living with the reality of maintaining software across a mix of frameworks and tools.</p><p>我们遇到的许多团队都会告诉我们，他们开始采用微服务、GraphQL或OpenTelemetry。当我问他们在新框架内已经提供了多少服务时，答案往往很小，尤其是对于几年以上的组织。其中一些组织会告诉我，他们实际上并不希望转换整个代码库。（例如，组织将期望与微服务一起维护其遗留的整体，或与GraphQL端点一起维护REST和gRPC端点。）对于许多其他组织来说，当我稍后查看一些季度时，他们在计划的迁移中往往没有预期的那么顺利——他们生活在跨各种框架和工具维护软件的现实中。</p><p>  Software buyers, from individual developers to directors and CIOs, know heterogeneity exists. But fully accepting this means:</p><p>软件购买者，从个人开发者到董事和首席信息官，都知道存在异质性。但完全接受这一点意味着：</p><p> Accepting slow migrations.  I’ve come across many teams that assume their problems will be solved once they finish migrating from outdated tool X to hot new tool Y, each of which lives in its own solution ecosystem. Unfortunately, the migration to tool X may not finish until the hot new tool is Z — and now you have the two-ecosystem problem again.</p><p>接受缓慢的迁移。我遇到过许多团队，他们认为一旦完成从过时的工具X到热门的新工具Y的迁移，他们的问题就会得到解决，每个团队都生活在自己的解决方案生态系统中。不幸的是，在热门的新工具是Z之前，到工具X的迁移可能不会完成——现在又出现了两个生态系统问题。</p><p> Accepting legacy subsystems.  I’ve come across many teams that focus on innovating their toolbox around the newer parts of their system. Unfortunately, the legacy subsystems aren’t going away — and having less tooling for them means you have longer triage and debug times when something goes wrong.</p><p>接受遗留子系统。我遇到过许多团队，他们专注于围绕系统的更新部分创新工具箱。不幸的是，遗留子系统并没有消失——而且为它们提供的工具更少，这意味着当出现问题时，您有更长的分类和调试时间。</p><p> Accepting that your APIs are unlikely to converge on GraphQL will lead you to invest in more sustainable, multi-API protocol tooling. Recognizing that your org is probably not going to convert all of its legacy monolith to microservices will allow you to invest in tooling that does not neglect monitoring and debugging code in either the monolith or the microservices.</p><p>接受您的API不太可能在GraphQL上聚合，这将导致您投资于更可持续的多API协议工具。认识到您的组织可能不会将其所有遗留的monolith转换为微服务，这将允许您投资于不会忽略对monolith或微服务中的代码进行监视和调试的工具。</p><p> On the builder side, it’s conventional wisdom that you go hard after homogeneity for the “land” and embrace heterogeneity for the “expand.” Whether you plan for heterogeneity will greatly impact how quickly you can expand. Certain kinds of developer tools need to be custom-built for each new language or framework. For instance, a tool that provides insights only for GraphQL APIs may not easily expand to other kinds of APIs, especially because GraphQL contains more rich information than do REST or gRPC.</p><p>在建设者方面，传统智慧认为，你努力追求“土地”的同质性，而拥抱“扩展”的异质性你是否计划异质性将极大地影响你的扩张速度。某些类型的开发工具需要为每种新语言或框架定制。例如，仅为GraphQL API提供洞察的工具可能不容易扩展到其他类型的API，尤其是因为GraphQL包含的信息比REST或gRPC更丰富。</p><p> Other kinds of developer tools can expand across languages and frameworks easily. A SaaS tool that simply needs to be able to be called from different programming languages supports language heterogeneity, as major core components do not have to be translated to support each new language.</p><p>其他类型的开发工具可以轻松地跨语言和框架扩展。只需要能够从不同编程语言调用的SaaS工具支持语言异构性，因为不必翻译主要核心组件来支持每种新语言。</p><p> 🛑 Stop thinking of software as homogeneously represented by a small number of unrepresentative
