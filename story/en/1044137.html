It’s everywhere and we’re  only getting more of it. For the last 5-10 years,  data science has attracted newcomers near and far trying to get a taste of that forbidden fruit.</p><p>数据。它无处不在，我们只会得到更多。在过去的5-10年中，数据科学吸引了越来越多的新人来尝试品尝这种禁果。</p><p>   TLDR: There are  70% more open roles at companies in  data engineering as compared to  data science. As we train the next generation of data and machine learning practitioners, let’s place more emphasis on engineering skills.</p><p>   TLDR：与数据科学相比，公司在数据工程领域的开放角色要多70％。在培训下一代数据和机器学习从业人员时，让我们更加注重工程技能。</p><p>  As part of my work developing an  educational platform for data professionals, I think a lot about how the market for data-driven (machine learning and data science) roles is evolving.</p><p>  在为数据专业人员开发教育平台的工作中，我对数据驱动（机器学习和数据科学）角色的市场正在如何发展进行了很多思考。</p><p> In talking to dozens of prospective entrants to data fields including students at top institutions around the world, I’ve seen a tremendous amount of confusion around what skills are most important to help candidates stand out in the crowd and prepare for their careers.</p><p> 在与包括全球顶尖机构的学生在内的数十个潜在数据进入者进行交谈时，我看到了对于最重要的技能（帮助候选人在人群中脱颖而出并为自己的职业生涯做准备）最困惑。</p><p> When you think about it, a  data scientist can be responsible for any subset of the following: machine learning modelling, visualization, data cleaning and processing (i.e. SQL wrangling), engineering, and production deployment.</p><p> 当您考虑时，数据科学家可以负责以下任何子集：机器学习建模，可视化，数据清理和处理（即SQL处理），工程和生产部署。</p><p>  Data speaks louder than words. So I decided to do an analysis of the data roles being hired for at every company coming out of  Y-Combinator since 2012. The questions that guided my research:</p><p>  数据胜于雄辩。因此，我决定对自2012年以来从Y-Combinator出来的每家公司聘用的数据角色进行分析。指导我研究的问题：</p><p>    I chose to do an analysis of YC portfolio companies that claim to make some sort of data work part of their value proposition.</p><p>    我选择对YC投资组合公司进行分析，这些公司声称将某种数据作为其价值主张的一部分。 </p><p> Why focus on YC? Well, for starters, they do a good job of providing an easily searchable (and scrapable)  directory of their companies.</p><p>为什么要关注YC？好吧，对于初学者来说，他们在提供容易搜索（可抓取）的公司目录方面做得很好。</p><p> In addition, as a particularly forward-thinking incubator that has funded companies from around the world across domains for over a decade, I felt they provided a representative sample of the market with which to conduct my analyses. That being said, take what I say wit a grain of salt, as I didn’t analyze super-large tech companies.</p><p> 此外，作为一个特别有远见的孵化器，它为来自各个领域的世界各地的公司提供了超过十年的资金，我觉得他们为进行分析提供了一个具有代表性的市场样本。话虽这么说，但请注意，因为我没有分析超大型科技公司。</p><p> I scraped the homepage URLs of every YC company since 2012, producing an initial pool of ~1400 companies.</p><p> 自2012年以来，我刮擦了每家YC公司的首页URL，最初形成了约1400家公司。</p><p> Why stop at 2012? Well, 2012 was the year that  AlexNet won the ImageNet competition, effectively kickstarting the machine learning and data-modelling wave we are now living through. It’s fair to say that this birthed some of the earliest generations of data-first companies.</p><p> 为什么要在2012年停下来？好吧，2012年是AlexNet赢得ImageNet竞赛的一年，有效地掀起了我们现在正在经历的机器学习和数据建模浪潮。可以说，这诞生了最早的数据优先公司。</p><p> From this initial pool, I performed keyword filtering to reduce the number of relevant companies I would have to look through. In particular, I only considered companies whose websites included at least one of the following terms: AI, CV, NLP, natural language processing, computer vision, artificial intelligence, machine, ML, data. I also disregarded companies whose website links were broken.</p><p> 从这个初始池中，我执行了关键字过滤，以减少需要浏览的相关公司的数量。特别是，我只考虑了其网站至少包含以下术语之一的公司：AI，CV，NLP，自然语言处理，计算机视觉，人工智能，机器，机器学习，数据。我也忽略了那些网站链接断开的公司。</p><p> Did this generate a ton of false positives? Absolutely! But here I was trying to prioritize high recall as much as possible, recognizing that I would do a more fine-grained manual inspection of the individual websites for relevant roles.</p><p> 这会产生大量误报吗？绝对！但是在这里，我认识到我将对各个网站进行更细粒度的手动检查以找到相关角色，因此我尝试尽可能地优先考虑高召回率。</p><p> With this reduced pool, I went through every site, found where they were advertising jobs (typically a  Careers,  Jobs, or  We’re Hiring page), and took note of every role that included data, machine learning, NLP, or CV in the title. This gave me a pool of about 70 distinct companies hiring for data roles.</p><p> 有了这个减少的资源池，我遍历了每个站点，找到了他们在哪里发布广告（通常是“职业，职位或我们正在招聘”页面），并记下了每个角色，包括数据，机器学习，NLP或CV。标题。这给了我大约70个不同的公司来招聘数据角色。 </p><p> One note here: it’s conceivable that I missed some companies as there were certain websites with very little information (typically those in stealth) that might actually be hiring. In addition, there were companies that didn’t have a formal  Careers page but asked that prospective candidates reach out directly via email.</p><p>这里有个提示：可以想见，我错过了一些公司，因为有些网站实际上很少招聘信息（通常是隐身的网站）。此外，有些公司没有正式的“职业”页面，但要求潜在候选人直接通过电子邮件与他们联系。</p><p> I disregarded both of these types of companies rather than reach out to them, so they are not part of this analysis.</p><p> 我忽略了这两种类型的公司，而不是与它们接触，因此它们不是此分析的一部分。</p><p> Another thing: the bulk of this research was done towards the final weeks of 2020. Open roles may have changed as companies update their pages periodically. However, I don’t believe this will drastically impact the conclusions drawn.</p><p> 另一件事：这项研究的大部分时间都是在2020年的最后几个星期完成的。随着公司定期更新其页面，公开职位可能已经改变。但是，我认为这不会严重影响得出的结论。</p><p>  Before diving into the results, it’s worth spending some time clarifying what responsibilities each data role is typically responsible for. Here are the four roles we will spend our time looking at with a short description of what they do:</p><p>  在深入研究结果之前，值得花一些时间来澄清每个数据角色通常负责什么职责。以下是我们将花时间介绍的四个角色，并简要说明了它们的作用：</p><p> Data scientist: Use various techniques in statistics and machine learning to process and analyse data. Often responsible for building models to probe what can be learned from some data source, though often at a prototype rather than production level.</p><p> 数据科学家：在统计和机器学习中使用各种技术来处理和分析数据。通常负责构建模型以探究可从某些数据源中学到的内容，尽管通常是在原型而非生产级别。</p><p> Data engineer: Develops a robust and scalable set of data processing tools/platforms. Must be comfortable with SQL/NoSQL database wrangling and building/maintaining ETL pipelines.</p><p> 数据工程师：开发一套强大且可扩展的数据处理工具/平台。必须熟悉SQL / NoSQL数据库的整理和构建/维护ETL管道。</p><p> Machine Learning (ML) Engineer: Often responsible for both training models and productionizing them. Requires familiarity with some high-level ML framework and also must be comfortable building scalable training, inference, and deployment pipelines for models.</p><p> 机器学习（ML）工程师：通常既负责培训模型，又负责生产模型。需要熟悉一些高级ML框架，还必须能够轻松构建模型的可扩展训练，推理和部署管道。 </p><p> Machine Learning (ML) Scientist: Works on cutting-edge research. Typically responsible for exploring new ideas that can be published at academic conferences. Often only needs to prototype new state-of-the-art models before handing off to ML engineers for productionization.</p><p>机器学习（ML）科学家：致力于前沿研究。通常负责探索可以在学术会议上发布的新想法。在移交给ML工程师进行生产之前，通常只需要对最新技术模型进行原型制作。</p><p>  So what happens when we plot the frequency of each data role that companies are hiring for? The plot looks like this:</p><p>  那么，当我们绘制公司要招聘的每个数据角色的频率时，会发生什么呢？情节看起来像这样：</p><p>  What immediately stands out is how many more open  data engineer roles there are compared to traditional  data scientists. In this case, the raw counts correspond to companies hiring  roughly 55% more for data engineers than data scientists, and roughly the same number of machine learning engineers as data scientists.</p><p>  立即脱颖而出的是，与传统数据科学家相比，开放数据工程师的角色增加了多少。在这种情况下，原始计数对应于公司为数据工程师雇用的人数比数据科学家多约55％，并且机器学习工程师的人数与数据科学家大致相同。</p><p> But we can do more. If you look at the titles of the various roles, there seems to be some repetition.</p><p> 但是我们可以做更多。如果您查看各个角色的职位，似乎有些重复。</p><p> Let’s only provide coarse-grained categorization through role consolidation. In other words, I took roles whose descriptions were roughly equivalent and consolidated them under a single title.</p><p> 我们只通过角色合并来提供粗粒度的分类。换句话说，我担任的角色的描述大致相同，并将其合并为一个标题。</p><p>  NLP engineer       ≈ \approx     ≈  CV engineer       ≈ \approx     ≈  ML engineer       ≈ \approx     ≈  Deep Learning engineer (while the domains might be different, the responsiblities are roughly the same)</p><p>  NLP工程师≈\ approx≈CV工程师≈\ approx≈ML工程师≈\ approx≈深度学习工程师（尽管领域可能不同，但职责大致相同）</p><p> ML scientist       ≈ \approx     ≈  Deep Learning researcher       ≈ \approx     ≈  ML intern (the internship description very much seemed research-focused)</p><p> ML科学家≈\ approx≈深度学习研究员≈\ approx≈ML实习生（实习描述似乎很注重研究） </p><p> Data engineer       ≈ \approx     ≈  Data architect       ≈ \approx     ≈  Head of data       ≈ \approx     ≈  Data platform engineer</p><p>数据工程师≈\ approx≈数据架构师≈\ approx≈数据头≈\ approx≈数据平台工程师</p><p>  If we don’t like dealing with raw counts, here are some percentages to put us at ease:</p><p>  如果我们不喜欢处理原始计数，请通过以下百分比让我们放心：</p><p>  I probably could have lumped  ML research engineer into one of the  ML scientist or  ML engineer bins, but given that it was a bit of a hybrid role, I left it as is.</p><p>  我可能可以将ML研究工程师归入ML科学家或ML工程师箱中，但是鉴于这是一种混合角色，我将其保留下来。</p><p> Overall the consolidation made the differences even more pronounced! There are  ~70% more open  data engineer than  data scientist positions. In addition, there are  ~40% more open  ML engineer than  data scientist positions. There are also only  ~30% as many  ML scientist as  data scientist positions.</p><p> 总体而言，合并使差异更加明显！开放数据工程师比数据科学家职位多70％。此外，开放式ML工程师比数据科学家职位多40％。机器学习科学家的数量也只有数据科学家职位的30％。</p><p>  Data engineers are in increasingly high demand compared to other data-driven professions. In a sense, this represents an evolution for the broader field.</p><p>  与其他数据驱动型行业相比，数据工程师的需求越来越高。从某种意义上说，这代表了更广阔领域的发展。</p><p> When machine learning become hot 🔥 5-8 years ago, companies decided they need people that can make classifiers on data. But then frameworks like  Tensorflow and  PyTorch became really good, democratizing the ability to get started with deep learning and machine learning.</p><p> 当机器学习在5到8年前变得炙手可热时，公司决定他们需要可以对数据进行分类的人员。但是随后Tensorflow和PyTorch之类的框架变得非常好，使深度学习和机器学习入门的能力民主化。</p><p>  Today, the bottleneck in helping companies get machine learning and modelling insights to production center on data problems.</p><p>  如今，帮助公司获得有关数据问题的机器学习和建模见解到生产中心的瓶颈。 </p><p> How do you annotate data? How do you process and clean data? How do you move it from A to B? How do you do this every day as quickly as possible?</p><p>您如何注释数据？您如何处理和清理数据？您如何将其从A移到B？您如何每天尽快做到这一点？</p><p>   This may sound boring and unsexy, but old-school software engineering with a bend toward data may be what we really need right now.</p><p>   这听起来可能很无聊而且很性感，但是偏向于数据的老式软件工程可能是我们目前真正需要的。</p><p> For years, we’ve become enamored with the idea of data professionals that breathe life into raw data thanks to cool demos and media hype. After all, when was the last time you saw a  TechCrunch article about an ETL pipeline?</p><p> 多年以来，我们一直迷恋数据专家的想法，这些专家凭借出色的演示和媒体炒作为原始数据注入生命。毕竟，什么时候您是最后一次看到TechCrunch有关ETL管道的文章？</p><p> If nothing else, I believe solid engineering is something we don’t emphasize enough in data science job training or educational programs. In addition to learning how to use  linear_regression.fit(), learn how to write a unit test too!</p><p> 如果没有别的，我相信在数据科学工作培训或教育计划中，我们对固态工程的重视不够。除了学习如何使用linear_regression.fit（）之外，还学习如何编写单元测试！</p><p>  What it means is that competition is going to be tougher. There are going to be fewer positions available for what is looking to be an abundance of newcomers to the market trained to do data science.</p><p>  这意味着竞争将更加艰难。对于正在接受训练有素的数据科学市场的新手来说，将会有越来越少的职位可用。</p><p> There will always be a need for people that can effectively analyze and extract actionable insights from data. But they have to be good.</p><p> 始终需要人们能够有效地分析数据并从数据中提取可行的见解。但是他们必须是好人。</p><p> Downloading a pretrained model off the Tensorflow website on the  Iris dataset probably is no longer enough to get that data science job.</p><p> 从Iris数据集上的Tensorflow网站下载经过预训练的模型可能不再足以完成该数据科学工作。 </p><p> It’s clear, however, with the large number of  ML engineer openings that companies often want a hybrid data practitioner: someone that can build and deploy models. Or said more succinctly, someone that can use Tensorflow but can also build it from source.</p><p>但是很明显，由于大量的ML工程师职位，公司经常需要混合数据从业人员：可以构建和部署模型的人。或者更简洁地说，可以使用Tensorflow但也可以从源代码构建它的人。</p><p> Another takeaway here is that there just aren’t that many ML research positions.</p><p> 这里的另一个收获是，只有很少的ML研究职位。</p><p> Machine learning research tends to get its fair share of hype because that’s where all the cutting-edge stuff happens, all the  AlphaGo and  GPT-3 and what-not.</p><p> 机器学习研究倾向于大肆宣传，因为这是所有最前沿的东西发生的地方，所有AlphaGo和GPT-3都没有。</p><p> But for many companies, especially early-stage ones, the bleeding-edge state-of-the-art may not be what’s needed anymore. Getting a model that’s 90% of the way there but can scale to 1000+ users is often more valuable to them.</p><p> 但是对于许多公司，尤其是早期公司而言，尖端的最新技术可能不再是必需的。取得模型的90％，但可以扩展到1000多个用户，通常对他们来说更有价值。</p><p> That’s not to say that there isn’t an important place for machine learning research. Absolutely not.</p><p> 这并不是说机器学习研究没有重要的场所。绝对不。</p><p> But you’ll probably find more of those kinds of roles at industry research labs that can afford to take capital-intensive bets for long stretches of time rather than at a seed-stage startup trying to demonstrate product-market fit to investors as it raises a Series A.</p><p> 但是，您可能会在行业研究实验室中找到更多这类角色，这些角色可以承受很长一段时间的资本密集型赌注，而不是在种子阶段的初创公司试图证明产品市场适合投资者时提高系列A。</p><p> If nothing else, I believe it’s important to make the expectations of newcomers to data fields reasonable and calibrated. We must acknowledge that  data science is different now. I hope this post was able to shed some light on the state of the field today. It’s only when we know where we are that we know where we need to go.</p><p> 如果没有其他事情，我认为重要的是要使新来者对数据字段的期望合理并经过校准。我们必须承认，数据科学现在与众不同。我希望这篇文章能够对当今的领域有所启发。只有当我们知道自己在哪里时，我们才知道需要去哪里。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.mihaileric.com/posts/we-need-data-engineers-not-data-scientists/">https://www.mihaileric.com/posts/we-need-data-engineers-not-data-scientists/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/科学家/">#科学家</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/数据/">#数据</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/data/">#data</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
