I want to get the point across that open source maintainers owe you quite literally nothing when it comes to their open source code, and treating them poorly is unethical. And to me, this is the underlying  social contract of open source.</p><p>即使我伴随着伴随的博客帖子，所有关于为开源参与的预期划分，我觉得有时间做另一个博客帖子，直接通过一些开源用户直接解决授权的授权问题，这两者都伤害了开源他们自己和他人。我想在那个开源维护者欠你的角度来看，当它到他们的开源代码方面没有任何字面意思，并且对待它们是不道德的。对我来说，这是开源的潜在社会合同。</p><p>   Open source software is  source code that is licensed in such a way that  I can use it for free.</p><p>   开源软件是许可的源代码，以便可以免费使用它。</p><p> Do open source projects that produce open source code  need to provide anything beyond this? I say  no: open source software starts and stops with the software and its license. But what if you want to have a more social aspect to your open source project and somehow be reachable by users? In that case I believe there&#39;s a bit more to be expected in the exchange and it mostly revolves around treating each other like human beings.</p><p> 开源项目，产生开源代码需要提供超出此处的任何东西吗？我说否：开源软件启动并停止使用软件及其许可证。但是，如果您想要为您的开源项目提供更多社交方面，请以某种方式通过用户访问？在这种情况下，我相信在交易所中有一点，它大多围绕着人类围绕人类治疗。</p><p>  To set the stage, I think it&#39;s important to establish what the relationship is between me as a maintainer and you as a user. I have been trying to come up with a real world example that maps well, and the best I have come up with is,</p><p>  为了设置舞台，我认为它很重要，建立了我作为维护者和你作为用户之间的关系。我一直试图提出一个真实的世界例，即地图嘛，我最好的是，</p><p> Open source code is like me putting a stack of USB drives with my open source code on them on my front lawn with a sign that says &#34;FREE&#34;, and you coming by and taking a USB drive when you want the latest copy of my open source code.</p><p> 打开源代码就像我用我的前草坪上用我的开源代码堆叠一堆USB驱动器，其中一个标志说＆＃34;免费＆＃34;，你想要和你想要的USB驱动器最新副本我的开源代码。</p><p> That&#39;s the actual, typical relationship I have with most users of my open source code: I push out a new commit, you use it, and we never speak to each other.</p><p> 那个＆＃39;我对我开放源代码的大多数用户的实际，典型的关系：我推出了一个新的提交，你用它，我们永远不会互相交谈。</p><p> With this example in mind, do you think it is reasonable to go up to my front door, knock, and then proceed to yell at me if you didn&#39;t like the software you chose to pick up off of my front yard for free? 🤨 How about leaving an angry letter in my mailbox? Or a flaming bag of 💩 on my doorstep? Or standing in the middle of the street in my town and yelling about how much you hate my software? This is what it&#39;s like when you email me angrily, open an issue in anger, or complain loudly on the internet. Does any of that seem reasonable? To me, this actually ranges from rude to unethical.</p><p> 在这个例子中，你认为去我的前门，敲门是合理的，然后如果你没有像你选择的软件一样，你选择了你的前院自由？ 🤨在我的邮箱中留下一个愤怒的信件怎么样？或者在我家门口上的火焰袋？或者站在我镇上的街道中间，大吼大叫你讨厌我的软件？这就是它＆＃39; s喜欢愤怒地给我发电子邮件时，在愤怒中开放问题，或在互联网上大声抱怨。有什么看起来合理吗？对我来说，这实际上是从粗鲁到不道德的范围。 </p><p> Remember that I didn&#39;t force you to take the software. The act of taking the software was done under free agency, so getting mad about the  free gift of some open source code that you chose to take seems to be more your own problem than mine; you are totally capable of using that free agency again and stop using the source code. This is equivalent to me giving you a free ice cream, licking it, not liking the flavour, and then proceeding to scream that the free ice cream is horrible because you don&#39;t like it. Doesn&#39;t seem like a reasonable response to something you chose to pick up for free and try, does it?</p><p>请记住，我没有强迫你拍摄软件。采用该软件的行为是在自由机构下完成的，因此对您选择采取的一些开源代码的免费礼物似乎是您自己的问题而不是我的问题;您完全能够再次使用该自由代理并停止使用源代码。这相当于我给你一个免费的冰淇淋，舔它，不喜欢味道，然后继续尖叫，因为你不喜欢它的自由冰淇淋是可怕的。 DON＆＃39; T似乎是一个合理的回应，你选择免费拿起并尝试，做到吗？</p><p> Now this isn&#39;t to say you can&#39;t give constructive criticism or say why something didn&#39;t work for you. But if you saw someone walk up to me and begin berating me over some free ice cream would you view that as acceptable or unreasonable? There&#39;s a big difference between, &#34;this isn&#39;t for me&#34;, and, &#34;this is utter trash and you should be ashamed of the job that you have done&#34; or &#34;you had cookies &amp; cream ice cream yesterday, why don&#39;t you have it today?!?&#34;</p><p> 现在这不是说你可以＆＃39; t给予建设性的批评或说出为什么没有为你工作的东西。但如果你看到有人走到我身边，开始用一些免费的冰淇淋，你会认为这是可接受的还是不合理的？在那里有很大的区别，＆＃34;这是我的＆＃34;和＃34;和，＆＃34;这是完全垃圾，你应该为你所做的工作感到羞耻和＃34;或＆＃34;你有饼干＆amp;昨天奶油冰淇淋，为什么＆＃39;今天你有它吗？！？＆＃34;</p><p>  You may have noticed I used a rather strong word earlier to label folks who abuse maintainers:  unethical. That was very much on purpose. I actually have a bachelors degree in philosophy, and in reflecting on the idea of users chastising maintainers simply because they don&#39;t like something made me have an epiphany grounded in moral philosophy.</p><p>  你可能已经注意到我早些时候使用相当强大的词来标记滥用维护者的人：不道德。这是故意的。我实际上有哲学学士学位，并反映了用户简单地对用户的想法，仅仅是因为他们不喜欢某种东西让我在道德哲学中接地的Epiphany。</p><p> The philosopher  Immanuel Kant had a moral philosophy system known as the   categorical imperative. A key tenant of Kant&#39;s moral philosophy is summed up by the following from his work,   Groundwork of the Metaphysics  of Morals:</p><p> 哲学家Immanuel康德有一个称为分类势在必可的道德哲学系统。康德＆＃39;道德哲学的关键租户由他的作品概括，道德的形而上学的基础：</p><p> Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.</p><p> 以这样的方式，你对人类对待人类，无论是在你自己的人还是在任何其他人身上，都不只是作为一个目的的手段，但总是与结束同时。</p><p> Let&#39;s tease apart what is meant here by &#34;means to an end&#34; and &#34;as an end&#34;. In the former case, using something as a &#34;means to an end&#34; is basically what it sounds like: using something in order to get something else. This could be something like I&#39;m going to perform some action  as a means to getting something specific out of it in the end.</p><p> 让＆＃39; s取差异在这里＆＃34的意思;意味着结束＆＃34;和＆＃34;作为一个结束＆＃34;在前一种情况下，使用某种东西作为＆＃34;意味着结束＆＃34;基本上它听起来像：使用某些东西以获得其他东西。这可能是我和＃39; m要执行一些动作，以便到最后从中获得特定事物的手段。</p><p> As for &#34;as an end&#34;, that is the concept of simply not using someone for an expected outcome. For instance, chances are the people in your life who are your friends not so because you expect to use them to get something, but because you simply like them for who they are. You are treating them  as an end in and of themselves because you are not spending time with them with expectations you will get something specific in the end.</p><p> 至于＆＃34;作为一个结束＆＃34;这是根本不使用某人的预期结果的概念。例如，你生活中的人们是你的朋友，因为你希望用它们来获得一些东西，但是因为你只是喜欢他们的东西。您正在将它们视为自己的结束，因为您没有与他们共度时光与他们一起度过，最终会得到特定的东西。 </p><p> How does this play into open source? When you treat a maintainer as a means to getting something from their software you are not morally treating them appropriately as an end (in other words, you&#39;re simply  using them), and thus not treating them morally as a human being. But when you treat a maintainer as a fellow human being who may be able to do you a favour of their own volition, then you end up in an appropriate relationship where you are not trying to  use the maintainer for something specific.</p><p>这对开源有何游戏？当您将维护者视为从他们的软件中获取某些东西的手段时，您并不是在道德上适当地将它们视为一端（换句话说，您只是使用它们），从而在道德上将它们视为人类。但是，当你把维护者视为一个人类的人可能能够对自己有利的人，那么你最终可以在一个适当的关系中，你没有试图为具体的东西使用维护者。</p><p>  Let&#39;s expand on this free USB drive example and say that some of my C code  happens to work with the  Alpha chipset (which happened to be discontinued in April 2007; 14 years ago as I write this). You use my software and you like it, so you keep using it. Then one day I inadvertently stop supporting Alpha because I want to use  Rust to be more productive, secure, and generally just happier when I write such low-level code than coding in C (yes, I&#39;m a fan of Rust 😁).</p><p>  让＆＃39;在这个免费的USB驱动器示例中展开并说明我的一些C代码恰好与阿尔法芯片组合作（这是在2007年4月中停止的; 14年前我写这个）。您使用我的软件，你喜欢它，所以你继续使用它。然后有一天，我无意中停止支持alpha，因为我想使用Rust才能更加富有成效，安全，并且通常更快乐，而不是在C中编写如C（是的，i＆＃39; Rust😁的Ma粉丝） 。</p><p> Do you think it&#39;s reasonable to get mad at me just because I changed the software such that you can&#39;t use it anymore? Remember you have been coming to my front yard to pick up a USB drive every time I make a change; I didn&#39;t ask you to use my software. I&#39;m the one doing all the work here in producing this open source code and I don&#39;t find supporting Alpha useful anymore, so why is it in any way reasonable to be mad at me for &#34;dropping&#34; Alpha support?</p><p> 你认为它是＆＃39;因为我改变了这个软件，以便你可以＆＃39;它不再使用它了吗？记住你一直来到我的前院每次改变时都会拿起USB驱动器;我没有要求你使用我的软件。我在这里做所有工作的人在制作这个开源代码中，我不再找到了支持的alpha了，所以为什么要以任何方式合理地为我生气和＃34;掉落和＃34; alpha支持？</p><p> To me, it feels like if you get mad at me for no longer supporting some platform that is treating me as a means to an end for getting to use  my software instead of as an end in and of myself. If you treated me as a human being you might ask if I would reconsider, but if I said &#34;no&#34; you would accept that and move on instead of getting mad at me.</p><p> 对我来说，如果你对我很生气，那就感觉不再支持一些对待我的平台，以便结束使用我的软件而不是自己的目的。如果你认为我是一个人，你可能会问我是否会重新考虑，但如果我说＆＃34;没有＃34;你会接受它并继续前进而不是生气。</p><p> To make this real for people, this entire scenario involving Alpha and Rust is based on an actual event in the Python community where a project got severely yelled at by some users who support Alpha and various other esoteric platforms because the project added Rust code to their project for Rust&#39;s security benefits (and for a project whose sole purpose is security, by the way).</p><p> 为了使这个真实的人来说，这种涉及Alpha和Rust的整个场景是基于Python社区的实际事件，其中一个项目由支持Alpha和各种其他宇宙平台的一些用户严重喊叫，因为该项目将生锈代码添加到他们的中生锈项目＆＃39;安全福利（以及唯一目的是安全的项目，顺便说一句）。</p><p>  The really sad thing in all of this is that those people who decide that yelling is acceptable and treat maintainers as a means to an end are actually hurting you as much as they are hurting themselves. Burnout for open source maintainers is a real problem. If someone constantly wrote you hate mail for some USB drives you left on your front yard you wouldn&#39;t want to bother putting things on your front yard anymore either. Every time an open source maintainer gets yelled at, the closer they are to doing something that makes things worse off for you.</p><p>  这一切都是真正悲伤的事情是那些决定大喊大叫的人是可接受的，并将维护者视为一定的手段实际上伤害了你，因为他们伤害了自己。开源维护者的倦怠是一个真正的问题。如果有人不断写下你讨厌的邮件为一些USB驱动器你留在你的前院你不会打扰在你的前院上留下东西。每次一个开源维护者都会被喊叫，他们越靠近做一些让你更糟糕的事情。</p><p> There are levels to the ramifications (which are all ultimately reasonable since they are up to the maintainer to do what they want with their open source code). The most common one is open source code becomes less considerate of others&#39; needs and more opinionated and focused on what the maintainer wants. That is reasonable, but it does mean someone&#39;s open source code has less of a chance of being useful to you since the focus is narrowed.</p><p> 有区别的水平（这一切都是最终合理的，因为它们由维护者做出他们想要的开源代码的事项）。最常见的一个是开源代码的不太体贴其他人和＃39;需要，更具自以为是，并专注于维护者想要的东西。这是合理的，但它确实意味着某人＆＃39;由于焦点缩小，因此开源代码具有较少的机会对您有用。 </p><p> Probably next is having  open source code but not open participation. This is when you&#39;re happy to share your open source code with others but you simply don&#39;t want the hassle of something like pull requests. This is very much like opinionated open source code, but now you&#39;re really at the mercy of the maintainer to implement it.</p><p>可能接下来是开源代码，但不开放参与。这是当你＆＃39;重新开始与他人分享你的开源代码，但你只是不希望像拉请求那样的东西。这是非常像自以为是开放的源代码，但现在你＆＃39;重新在维护者的怜悯中实现它。</p><p> After this it&#39;s abandoning the project. The issue tracker is still open so people can collect issues with the open source code, maybe even coordinate on patches or a fork, but the maintainer is gone and the commits have ceased.</p><p> 在此之后，＆＃39; s放弃项目。问题跟踪器仍然是开放的，因此人们可以使用开源代码收集问题，甚至可以在修补程序或叉子上协调，但维护者已经消失，并且提交已停止。</p><p> Next up is locking down the project. Now it&#39;s just an archive of a project and all you get is what&#39;s already there.</p><p> 接下来正在锁定项目。现在它只是一个项目的档案，你所得到的一切都在那里。</p><p> Lastly, there&#39;s full-on deletion. No more repository with releases yanked from PyPI; if you didn&#39;t keep your own copy of the open source code then it&#39;s gone forever for you.</p><p> 最后，全面删除了＆＃39;没有更多的存储库，释放来自pypi的释放;如果你没有＆＃39; t保留自己的开源代码副本，然后＆＃39; s永远为你。</p><p> All of this is what makes it frustrating when bad actors &#34;get&#34; what they want because they only sort of do. While some specific feature or bug fix might go in, they still pushed the maintainer closer to burnout due to their actions. That could lead to the project being eventually shut down which is likely worse than that single feature or bug fix the harasser wanted.</p><p> 所有这一切都是让它在糟糕的演员＆＃34; Get＆＃34;他们想要的是因为他们只是有点。虽然某些特定的特征或错误修复可能进入，但由于其操作，它们仍将维护者推向更接近倦怠。这可能导致项目最终关闭，这可能比单一特征或错误修复骚扰者想要的更糟糕。</p><p> And it all sucks for you, too. This is why I try not to stand by when a maintainer is receiving abuse since there are impacts much wider than the single bad interaction. I&#39;m not condoning stooping to the level of the person who&#39;s mistreating the maintainer to get them to go away, but stepping in and trying to defuse the situation and stick up for the maintainer is something I wish more people did (as well as simply banishing bad actors from their projects).</p><p> 这也适合你。这就是为什么我尽量不要忍受的时候，当维护者接受滥用时，因为存在比单个不良互动要宽得多。我并不是在欺骗维护者的人的水平屈服于抚摸他们让他们离开的人的水平，但是踩到并试图拆除局势并坚持维护者是我希望更多人的态度做了（以及简单地从他们的项目中丧生糟糕的演员）。</p><p>   Every commit of open source code should be viewed as an independent gift from the maintainer that they happened to leave on their front yard for others to enjoy if they so desire; treating them as a means to and for their open source code is unethical.</p><p>   开放源代码的每一项承诺都应被视为维护者的独立礼品，他们碰巧他们曾在他们的前院留下，因为他们愿意享受他们的愿望;将它们视为对其开源代码的手段是不道德的。 </p><p> There should be no expectations toward the next commit, next release, etc. when you realize open source maintainers really don&#39;t owe you anything. If you view open source code from that perspective then you will view it as a gift when it exists at all. As such, hopefully you feel less frustrated when open source doesn&#39;t go the way you want since it was all a gift to begin with. And that then will lead you to treat maintainers as an end and as a fellow human being.</p><p>应该没有对下一个提交，下一个释放等的期望。当您实现开源维护者真正不欠您任何东西时，请否则。 如果从该透视中查看开源代码，那么您将在其存在时将其视为礼物。 因此，希望您在开源不令人沮丧时感到不那么沮丧，因为这是一份才能开始的方式。 然后将导致您将维护者视为结束，作为一个人。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://snarky.ca/the-social-contract-of-open-source/">https://snarky.ca/the-social-contract-of-open-source/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/开源/">#开源</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/contract/">#contract</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/维护者/">#维护者</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
