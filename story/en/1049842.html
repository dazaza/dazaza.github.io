Brukiewicz sometimes talks, but he mostly listens. “I’m an introvert, so I don’t like to speak up,” he says. He’s also not a native English speaker, and sometimes finds the language barrier intimidating. Then a friend complained that it’s difficult for moderators to know who to call on in a large audience, and Brukiewicz had an idea: What if there were a Clubhouse feature where you could type your thoughts?</p><p>大约一个月前，Marcin Brukiewicz赢得了Clubhouse的邀请，并开始在音频应用程序上花费数小时。波兰医师Brukiewicz参加了讨论健康护理和医疗技术未来的会议室，并在医疗创新者俱乐部和全球健康俱乐部等领域与来自世界各地的人们会面。 Brukiewicz有时会讲话，但他大多会听。他说：“我是一个内向的人，所以我不想大声说出来。”他也不讲英语，有时会发现语言障碍令人生畏。然后，一个朋友抱怨说，主持人很难知道在大范围的观众中谁该打来电话，而Brukiewicz有一个主意：如果有一个Clubhouse功能可以输入您的想法，该怎么办？</p><p> Over the weekend, Brukiewicz built  Ask Clubhouse, a simple web tool for managing audience Q&amp;As on Clubhouse. Moderators can set up a “board,” link it to a Clubhouse room, and invite audience members to type their questions or comments, which the mods can then see in real time. Brukiewicz launched the site over the weekend; on Monday, he said, people had created about 50 different boards. He thinks some moderators will use it to manage large audiences; other people might find comfort in typing rather than talking, which could also make the platform more accessible. Brukiewicz hopes Clubhouse one day builds a version of this feature natively. For now, though, people can use his workaround.</p><p> 上周末，布鲁基维奇（Brukiewicz）建立了Ask Clubhouse，这是一个简单的网络工具，用于管理Clubhouse上的观众问答。主持人可以设置“面板”，将其链接到俱乐部会议室，并邀请听众键入他们的问题或评论，然后mod可以实时查看这些问题或评论。 Brukiewicz在周末推出了该网站。他说，周一，人们创建了大约50个不同的委员会。他认为某些主持人将使用它来管理大量受众。其他人可能会觉得打字而不是说话感到舒适，这也可以使平台更易于访问。 Brukiewicz希望Clubhouse有一天在本地构建此功能的版本。但是，现在，人们可以使用他的解决方法。</p><p> When  Clubhouse launched last spring, it served as an intimate gathering space for the early adopter crowd. But in the past two months, the invite-only app has exploded in popularity, and now has over 10 million users according to the researcher  Vajresh Balaji. Many of those new users are arriving on the platform with ideas about how to make it better, or how to maximize functionality with existing features. Brukiewicz’s tool is just one of many that have been invented in the last month:  Clubpad offers a free soundboard for use in Clubhouse rooms: a drumroll, a sad trombone, the timer from  Jeopardy!, a DJ horn.  Host Notes gives moderators a space for links, meeting agendas, and discussion summaries.  Clubhouse Recorder is a Telegram bot lets people record audio from a room.  ClubLink,  Clubhype, and  shorten.club each shorten links to Clubhouse rooms to make them easier to share on social media. There  are  at  least  four apps for adding a colorful ring around your Clubhouse avatar.</p><p> Clubhouse于去年春季推出时，为早期采用者提供了一个亲密的聚会场所。但是在过去的两个月中，仅邀请应用程序已迅速普及，据研究人员Vajresh Balaji称，该应用程序现已拥有超过1000万用户。这些新用户中的许多人都对如何使平台变得更好或如何利用现有功能最大化功能提出了想法。 Brukiewicz的工具只是上个月发明的众多工具之一：Clubpad提供了可在会所房间使用的免费音板：鼓声，悲伤的长号，来自Jeopardy！的计时器，DJ喇叭。 Host Notes为主持人提供了链接，会议议程和讨论摘要的空间。 Clubhouse Recorder是一种Telegram机器人，可让人们录制房间的音频。 ClubLink，Clubhype和Short.club都缩短了与Clubhouse房间的链接，使它们更易于在社交媒体上共享。至少有四个应用程序可在Clubhouse头像周围添加彩色戒指。</p><p>  Other users, eyeing Clubhouse’s staggering $1 billion valuation, see a way to make money. There’s  another soundboard—this one sold for $2.99 in the App Store.  Direcon offers analytics for power users who pay a monthly fee; it’s already raised a seed round. “There’s this cottage industry of people now getting on the platform who are trying to capitalize on the moment,” says Chris Messina, a product strategist and early Clubhouse user.</p><p>  其他用户则关注Clubhouse惊人的10亿美元估值，他们找到了一种赚钱的方法。还有另一种音板-该音板在App Store中以2.99美元的价格售出。 Direcon为按月付费的高级用户提供分析功能；它已经筹集了种子轮。产品策略师和Clubhouse的早期用户Chris Messina表示：“如今，这个平房行业的人们正在试图利用这一平台来利用这一机会。”</p><p>  Messina, who was also an early adopter on Instagram and Twitter, says this kind of symbiosis happens once platforms reach a certain level of maturation. Some users end up building functionality that make their own experience better: Imgur, for example, started as a workaround for sharing photos on Reddit, seven years before the platform introduced a native image-upload feature. Messina himself is well known for  creating the hashtag on Twitter as a way to organize the platform into groups of ideas; Twitter later took the idea and ran with it. “People solve their own problems,” he says.</p><p>  梅西纳（Messina）也是Instagram和Twitter的早期采用者，他说，一旦平台达到一定的成熟水平，这种共生就会发生。一些用户最终构建了使自己的体验更好的功能：例如，Imgur最初是在Reddit上共享照片的一种变通方法，距平台引入本机图像上传功能还不到七年。墨西拿本人以在Twitter上创建主题标签而闻名，这是一种将平台组织成想法组的方式。 Twitter后来接受了这个想法并予以支持。他说：“人们可以解决自己的问题。”</p><p>  On Clubhouse, it’s no different. People have been working within the constraints of the app to make it work for them. For example: There’s no way to share images, so some people use their avatar to show charts or other visuals that may be relevant to a room. There’s no way to share notes or links, so some people add link trees to their bio where more information can be found. Clubhouse does not have the UI to show which rooms are on-the-record, so people add red dots, in emoji, to the names of rooms that are being recorded.</p><p>  在Clubhouse上，没有什么不同。人们一直在应用程序的限制内工作，以使其适合他们。例如：无法共享图像，因此某些人使用其头像来显示可能与房间相关的图表或其他视觉效果。无法共享注释或链接，因此有些人将链接树添加到自己的个人资料中，从而可以找到更多信息。 Clubhouse没有UI来显示正在记录的房间，因此人们在表情符号中向正在记录的房间名称添加红点。</p><p>  Some have taken that kind of creative problem-solving further, to build their own businesses.  YoYo Club—advertised as the “Eventbrite for Clubhouse”—gives moderators a way to plan and promote future Clubhouse rooms, cutting through the noise of Clubhouse’s notifications. “You follow people and then you end up getting 60 Clubhouse notifications every hour,” says Peter Swain, YoYo Club’s cofounder. “So I’m not actually getting notifications from the people I’m interested in anymore. And meanwhile, people come into rooms saying, ‘I wish I’d known about this a few hours ago.’” Recognizing the need, Swain and his cofounder prototyped the app in a few weeks. Right now, moderators can use it to show audience members when they have upcoming events scheduled.</p><p>  有些人采取了这种创造性的解决问题的方法，进一步发展了自己的业务。被称为“俱乐部会所的Eventbrite”的YoYo俱乐部为主持人提供了一种计划和推广未来俱乐部会所客房的方式，从而消除了俱乐部会所的通知声。 YoYo Club的联合创始人彼得·斯温（Peter Swain）说：“跟随人们，然后您每小时就会收到60条Clubhouse通知。” “因此，我实际上不再从我感兴趣的人那里收到通知。同时，人们走进房间说：“我希望几个小时前就知道这一点。”” Swain和他的联合创始人认识到了这种需求，并在几周内为该应用程序制作了原型。现在，主持人可以使用它向预定的即将举行的活动的观众显示。 </p><p> YoYo Club is currently free to use, though Swain hopes that power users will eventually want to pay for it. As he sees it, there are already people with millions of followers on the platform, and an emerging set of influencers who host dozens of rooms a week. Those people will likely need premium features to enhance  their businesses, as full-time Clubhouse hosts. He’s also aware that Clubhouse is still in its early days and could easily put the kibosh on his idea by building it natively. “If you want to base your business model around somebody else’s platform, that’s a risk,” he says. “Will Clubhouse build what I built? Probably. Can I stay one step ahead of them? Also probably.”</p><p>尽管Swain希望高级用户最终愿意为此付费，但YoYo Club目前可以免费使用。正如他所看到的那样，平台上已经有数以百万计的追随者，并且有一群新兴的有影响力的人每周主持数十个房间。作为专职Clubhouse的托管人，这些人可能需要高级功能来增强业务。他还知道，Clubhouse仍处于起步阶段，可以通过在本地构建它来轻松实现其目标。他说：“如果您想基于他人平台建立业务模型，那将是一种风险。” “会所会建造我所建造的吗？大概。我可以领先他们一步吗？也可能。”</p><p> Direcon, the so-called “Tweetdeck for Clubhouse,” is already monetizing its suite of tools, by charging users a $50 monthly subscription fee. It can measure the total number of listeners in a room, average time listened, number of hands raised, and the average &#34;stickiness&#34; of the room. Direcon began as a tool for Instagram users, but found itself in an already-saturated market. This month, its cofounders—a group of five Turkish entrepreneurs—reinvented the app for Clubhouse.</p><p> Direcon，即所谓的“ Tweetdeck for Clubhouse”，已经通过向用户收取每月50美元的订阅费来利用其工具套件获利。它可以衡量一个房间中听众的总数，平均收听时间，举手的数量以及平均“粘性”。房间的。 Direcon最初是供Instagram用户使用的工具，但在一个已经饱和的市场中发现了自己。本月，由五位土耳其企业家组成的联合创始人重新发明了Clubhouse的应用程序。</p><p> “The lack of insights on Clubhouse makes it really hard to understand the campaigns’ performance and we thought it should be developed as soon as possible,” says Buğra Kaan Ayaz, one Direcon’s cofounders. Already, he says that a few thousand moderators have started using the service. The goal is to become “the most advanced analytics platform for Clubhouse.” That could either mean a steady stream of subscription income, or an acquisition: Recall that Tweetdeck was  purchased by Twitter in 2011, for a reported $40 million.</p><p> “对Clubhouse的缺乏见识使我们很难理解竞选活动的表现，我们认为应该尽快进行开发，” Direcon的联合创始人BuğraKaan Ayaz说。他说，已经有数千名主持人开始使用该服务。目标是成为“ Clubhouse的最先进的分析平台”。这可能意味着稳定的订阅收入来源，或者意味着收购：回想一下Tweetdeck在2011年被Twitter收购，据报道为4000万美元。</p><p> It’s not all smooth sailing for would-be Clubhouse entrepreneurs. The company does not have an official API, or  application programming interface, which allows outside developers to “plug into” a platform. Without that, third-party apps like Direcon rely on workarounds for their functionality. When it first launched on February 22, Direcon asked users to log in with their Clubhouse username and password, in order to access room data and provide analytics. After people pointed out that this method presented security issues and a risk of users being banned from Clubhouse altogether, Ayaz says the app changed tack and no longer requires people to sign in with their Clubhouse credentials. “All the live features related to analytics will remain the same,” he adds. “Our incoming moderation feature will be slightly different.” In comments on Direcon’s  blog post and on Twitter, some users claimed they were having trouble with their Clubhouse accounts. Ayaz says this was due to a bug with Clubhouse, not Direcon;  another post by the company was updated overnight to say the issue had been resolved.</p><p> 对于潜在的会所企业家来说，这并非一帆风顺。该公司没有官方的API或应用程序编程接口，该接口不允许外部开发人员“插入”平台。否则，Direcon等第三方应用程序将依靠变通办法来实现其功能。 2月22日首次启动时，Direcon要求用户使用其Clubhouse用户名和密码登录，以便访问会议室数据并提供分析。在人们指出这种方法带来了安全性问题以及完全禁止用户使用Clubhouse的风险之后，Ayaz说该应用程序已更改了标识，不再要求人们使用其Clubhouse凭据登录。他补充说：“与分析相关的所有实时功能将保持不变。” “我们的传入审核功能将略有不同。”在对Direcon的博客文章和Twitter的评论中，一些用户声称他们在使用Clubhouse帐户时遇到了麻烦。阿亚兹说，这是由于Clubhouse的错误，而不是Direcon的错误。该公司的另一则帖子在一夜之间得到了更新，表示该问题已解决。</p><p>  “Clubhouse now has to make an executive decision: Do we want to allow other people to build apps?” says Messina. Other social media companies like Facebook and Twitter have used their APIs to encourage whole developer ecosystems that made their products more useful to even more people, enabling that much more growth. Third-party apps can also be a risk, however. For a young company like Clubhouse, it means giving up some control of a platform and business model that has yet to be fully established. And while APIs can enable users to try third-party apps without handing over their passwords,  history  has  shown that doesn’t always mean users are more secure.</p><p>  “ Clubhouse现在必须做出一项行政决定：我们是否要允许其他人来构建应用程序？”墨西拿说。其他社交媒体公司（例如Facebook和Twitter）已使用其API来鼓励整个开发人员生态系统，从而使他们的产品对更多人更加有用，从而实现了更大的增长。但是，第三方应用程序也可能存在风险。对于像Clubhouse这样的年轻公司来说，这意味着放弃对尚未完全建立的平台和业务模型的控制。尽管API可以使用户无需交出密码即可尝试第三方应用，但历史表明，这并不总是意味着用户会更安全。</p><p> Other social platforms, like Twitter and Instagram, have also faced these questions. The only difference, Messina says, is the timing. “Clubhouse has been out for less than a year, and we’re already seeing what it took five to six years for Twitter to go through.”</p><p> Twitter和Instagram等其他社交平台也面临这些问题。墨西拿说，唯一的区别是时间。 “会所已经不到一年了，我们已经看到Twitter花费了五到六年的时间。”</p><p> Clubhouse did not respond to requests for comment. The platform is still in closed beta, and has been fairly guarded about its plans. If you’re still waiting for your Clubhouse invite, though, there’s a  burgeoning  ecosystem of profiteers to help with that, too.</p><p> 俱乐部会所未回复置评请求。该平台仍处于内测阶段，并且对其计划一直保持警惕。不过，如果您仍在等待俱乐部会所邀请，也将有一个新兴的获利者生态系统来帮助您。 </p><p>   🏃🏽‍♀️ Want the best tools to get healthy?
