I’m Simon, the Director of Engineering at Kraken leading the Core Backend team.  I’d like to provide a retrospective of the Core Backend team’s usage of Rust the last two years and share our perspective building with it at scale. There are many great online resources explaining how Rust is different and why it is a great language. This is no such blog post, however. It is our hope that this article will be a helpful resource to companies considering building with Rust and to developers who want to invest the time learning the language.  Finally, this is also a massive  thank you  to all who helped make Rust possible, and a way for Kraken to contribute positively to this movement.</p><p> 嗨👋！我是Kraken的工程总监Simon，领导核心后端团队。我想回顾一下Core Backend团队在过去两年中对Rust的使用情况，并与我们一起大规模地分享我们的观点。有许多很棒的在线资源介绍了Rust的不同之处以及为什么它是一门伟大的语言。但是，这不是这样的博客文章。我们希望本文将对考虑使用Rust进行开发的公司以及想要投入时间来学习该语言的开发人员有所帮助。最后，这也非常感谢所有帮助使Rust成为可能的人，也是Kraken为这一运动做出积极贡献的一种方式。</p><p>   Often, building a solution from scratch to replace one problem leaves us with another. This is particularly common when the original developers are not part of the design and implementation of the new solution. Other times, the new solution is theoretically better, but takes too much time to be ready, slowing down progress on the system actively serving requests. While we can make sure to avoid these common pitfalls, it is important to challenge the need for a rewrite in the first place.</p><p>   通常，从头开始构建解决方案来替代一个问题会给我们带来另一个问题。当原始开发人员不参与新解决方案的设计和实现时，这种情况尤其常见。有时，新的解决方案从理论上讲会更好，但是要准备好太多的时间，这会减慢主动服务请求的系统的进度。尽管我们可以确保避免这些常见的陷阱，但是首先挑战进行重写的需求非常重要。</p><p> When Kraken was founded in 2011, PHP offered a mix of execution safety, speed and productivity. It is impressive to see how much functionality was built in the early days. However, Kraken has grown dramatically since, and it has become difficult to expand the PHP code base, share the know-how and make larger changes safely. These core services deal with distributed data storage, cryptography and information security considerations which are less likely to be common skill sets among PHP developers, who are generally more focused on building on existing Web and e-commerce frameworks.</p><p> Kraken于2011年成立时，PHP提供了执行安全性，速度和生产率的完美结合。令人印象深刻的是在早期建立了多少功能。但是，从那以后，Kraken取得了长足的发展，并且很难扩展PHP代码库，共享专有技术并安全地进行较大的更改。这些核心服务处理分布式数据存储，加密和信息安全性方面的考虑，这在PHP开发人员中不太可能是常见的技能，而PHP开发人员通常更专注于在现有Web和电子商务框架上进行构建。</p><p> More generally, Kraken has entered a stage of   hypergrowth  with which the code base and tools need to keep up. In this regard, dynamically typed programming languages are great to start building, but it becomes more difficult to maintain code as the code base and number of engineers grow. Strong types provide guarantees (and formal documentation) that enable fast development and more developers to work on a single code base.</p><p> 更普遍的是，Kraken进入了高速增长的阶段，在此阶段，代码库和工具都需要跟上发展。在这方面，动态类型的编程语言非常适合开始构建，但是随着代码库和工程师人数的增加，维护代码变得更加困难。强类型提供了保证（和正式文档），这些保证使快速开发和更多开发人员可以在单个代码库上工作。</p><p>   It was acknowledged early in 2018 that remaining with PHP was not the best long-term solution to achieve these goals.</p><p>   人们在2018年初就认识到，保留PHP并不是实现这些目标的最佳长期解决方案。</p><p>  Early 2018, Kraken already had production services written in Go and C++. While Rust promised performance, security and modern language constructs, picking it as the language to rewrite core services was a bet.</p><p>  2018年初，Kraken已经提供了用Go和C ++编写的生产服务。尽管Rust保证了性能，安全性和现代语言的结构，但将其作为重写核心服务的语言是一个赌注。 </p><p> Kraken is very security-minded. As such, we prefer not to let C++ code run against user input. Even the best C++ teams in the world, like those building Windows™ or Chrome™, produce code where about   70% of CVEs are due to   memory safety  issues  ‒such as use after free, buffer overflows, double free, that can lead to privilege escalation or accessing memory‒ that are completely prevented by languages such as Java, Go or Rust.</p><p>Kraken非常注重安全性。因此，我们不想让C ++代码针对用户输入运行。即使是世界上最好的C ++团队（例如构建Windows™或Chrome™的团队），也会在代码中产生约70％的CVE是由于内存安全性问题而导致的-诸如释放后使用，缓冲区溢出，双重释放等会导致特权Java，Go或Rust等语言完全禁止升级或访问内存。</p><p> While Go protects against this specific class of vulnerabilities, it does not provide modern programming features like   generics  or   sum types  which ultimately lead to data modelling issues or repetitions. Kotlin provides a more elaborate type system and like Go, it makes asynchronous programming relatively easy, but comes with a Java ecosystem carrying a lot of legacy.</p><p> 尽管Go可以防御此类特定的漏洞，但它没有提供诸如通用或求和类型之类的现代编程功能，这些功能最终会导致数据建模问题或重复。 Kotlin提供了一个更复杂的类型系统，并且像Go一样，它使异步编程相对容易，但是带有一个带有许多遗留物的Java生态系统。</p><p> Enter Rust. Its reliability and performance has made it successful in cryptocurrency and blockchain projects. A few Kraken engineers started experimenting and saw it as an opportunity to build a lasting system that would match Kraken’s backend needs: performance similar to C++, modern language constructs helping to accurately model business logic and error cases, planned first-class support of asynchronous programming, compile-time thread safety, and a vibrant ecosystem. The value proposition of Rust and the demonstrated success of the community led Kraken to begin rewriting core services in Rust mid-2018.</p><p> 输入Rust。它的可靠性和性能使其在加密货币和区块链项目中取得了成功。一些Kraken工程师开始进行试验，并视其为构建满足Kraken后端需求的持久系统的机会：类似于C ++的性能，现代语言构造有助于准确地建模业务逻辑和错误情况，计划的对异步编程的一流支持，编译时线程安全和充满活力的生态系统。 Rust的价值主张和社区取得的成功使Kraken开始在2018年中开始重写Rust的核心服务。</p><p>  The Core Backend team has grown up and nowadays is in charge of both the modern Rust core services and the legacy PHP services that are still being rewritten. In the meantime, Rust has been successfully used by other teams: we’ve been joined by the Kraken Futures team who had independently started its migration to Rust for all of its backend stack,   Cryptowatch has picked Rust for its desktop application , Kraken moved its cold storage system to Rust and the   Kraken Digital Asset Bank  is being built in Rust.  The language itself has improved significantly, making writing asynchronous network services easier than ever.</p><p>  Core Backend团队已经成长，如今负责现代的Rust核心服务和仍在重写的遗留PHP服务。同时，Rust已被其他团队成功使用：Kraken Futures团队加入了我们的行列，该团队独立地开始将其所有后端堆栈迁移到Rust，Cryptowatch选择了Rust作为其桌面应用程序，Kraken迁移了其Rust的冷库系统，Rust正在建立Kraken Digital Asset Bank。该语言本身已得到显着改进，从而使编写异步网络服务比以往更加容易。</p><p> Generally, we have been pretty busy: the Core Backend team’s Rust git repositories hold about 500,000 lines of code – more than PHP, even though many features are still implemented in PHP. This is partly due to writing more foundational code, tests and brand new features, but also to the fact that PHP, like other dynamically typed programming languages, does not require to type structure definitions, including errors, which make up for a sizable portion of the Rust code. Not having those explicit structures in PHP has made the rewrites almost an exercise in reverse engineering.</p><p> 总的来说，我们一直很忙：Core Backend团队的Rust git存储库保存了约500,000行代码，比PHP还要多，尽管许多功能仍在PHP中实现。这部分是由于编写了更多的基础代码，测试和全新功能，而且还因为PHP与其他动态类型化的编程语言一样，不需要键入结构定义（包括错误），而该结构定义弥补了错误的大部分。 Rust代码。在PHP中没有那些显式的结构使得重写几乎是逆向工程中的一种练习。</p><p> Tactically, we have decided to rewrite the exact same functionality in Rust: since all PHP services are stateless, it made it easy to port the logic, endpoint by endpoint, to Rust. This has allowed a freshly hired team to gain more knowledge about the underlying system and made an incremental roll-out as well as easy roll-backs possible. We have built a comprehensive integration test suite that needs to pass against both PHP and Rust services to ensure the behavior is similar. After a functionality is ported to Rust, it is easier and safer to extend.</p><p> 从策略上讲，我们决定重写Rust中完全相同的功能：由于所有PHP服务都是无状态的，因此可以轻松地将逻辑（逐个端点）移植到Rust。这样一来，新聘的团队就可以获得有关底层系统的更多知识，并可以进行增量部署以及轻松回滚。我们已经构建了一个全面的集成测试套件，该套件需要针对PHP和Rust服务进行传递，以确保行为相似。将功能移植到Rust后，可以更轻松，更安全地进行扩展。</p><p> While the   primary  goal of the rewrite was not performance, it is great to see Rust provide fantastic speed out of the box. Our Tokio-powered RPC servers, which were not particularly optimized (though we are generally careful with memory usage patterns), support a throughput of 150k request/second per instance while keeping p99.9 latencies below 3ms.  A system is as fast as its slowest parts, and while our PHP core services are not the only bottlenecks at Kraken, their IO performance is lower than Rust’s and they are more sensitive to load. After entire end-to-end paths have been migrated to Rust and bottlenecks eliminated, our clients should see dramatic improvements. In the meantime, we do everything to improve performance and reliability by moving endpoints to Rust, redesigning databases and scaling up services.</p><p> 尽管重写的主要目标不是性能，但很高兴看到Rust提供开箱即用的惊人速度。我们的Tokio驱动的RPC服务器没有进行特别优化（尽管我们通常对内存使用模式非常谨慎），每个实例支持150k请求/秒的吞吐量，同时将p99.9延迟保持在3ms以下。系统的运行速度与其最慢的部分一样快，虽然我们的PHP核心服务并不是Kraken的唯一瓶颈，但它们的IO性能要比Rust的低，并且对负载更敏感。在将整个端到端路径迁移到Rust并消除瓶颈之后，我们的客户应该会看到巨大的进步。同时，我们通过将端点移至Rust，重新设计数据库和扩展服务来尽一切努力来提高性能和可靠性。 </p><p>    Rust is often touted as a great systems programming language ideally suited to lower-level tasks, command-line utilities and network services such as load balancers. Many people consider Rust’s complexity a deal breaker for general business logic, and the job market pool too small to use the language for common tasks such as building a user management system or a REST API.</p><p>Rust经常被吹捧为理想地适用于级别任务，命令行公用事业和网络服务（如负载均衡器）的伟大系统编程语言。许多人认为Rust的复杂性是一般业务逻辑的交易破坏者，并且工作市场池太小，无法使用语言进行常见任务，例如构建用户管理系统或REST API。</p><p> While Rust   is  a great fit for systems programming, we have also been using it for application services that are commonly implemented in languages considered higher-level such as Java, Ruby or TypeScript. Correctness is absolutely critical at Kraken, and Rust’s modern language constructs make it easier to write correct, robust code. The lack of garbage collection, often brought up as a downside for writing general logic that does not need to “care” about memory management, has not been a problem in practice, as we are building stateless services and storing cyclic data is never a concern.</p><p> 虽然生锈非常适合系统编程，但我们也一直在使用它用于常用语言中的应用服务，被认为是更高级别的诸如Java，Ruby或CypeScript。正确性在克拉肯绝对关键，Rust的现代语言构造使得更容易写正确，强大的代码。缺乏垃圾收集，经常被提升为写作一般逻辑，不需要“关心”记忆管理，在实践中并不是一个问题，因为我们正在构建无星级服务并存储循环数据永远不会是一个问题。</p><p> However, Rust requires precision and I’d say this has been the most beneficial aspect of the language: its explicitness, supported by its strong type system, leads to expressive code that is easy to review and reliable at runtime. In that regard, I’d consider Rust both lower-level   and  higher-level than Java and other languages of the same category. The Core Backend team also develops some more technical services such as load balancers, or services monitoring streams, that require good performance, and it has been extremely practical not to have to switch between systems and application logic languages, and reuse libraries and patterns.</p><p> 然而，RURT需要精确，我会说这是语言最有益的方面：它的明确性，由其强大的系统支持，导致表现力的代码，在运行时很容易审查和可靠。在这方面，我考虑生锈比Java和其他语言的较低级别和更高级别。核心后端团队还开发了一些技术服务，如负载均衡器或服务监控流，需要良好的性能，并且它非常实用，不必在系统和应用程序逻辑语言之间切换，并重用库和模式。</p><p> As the team and code base grow, the ability to review code effectively is critical. Rust is remarkable for making behavior very explicit in isolation, by which I mean it is not necessary to think as much about other parts of the system ‒ the current function is often enough. When reviewing code, we are presented with a   diff  (the lines that have changed and the surrounding context) and while one can take more time to dig into the changes, a faster review is a great motivator for developers who can get feedback rapidly. In Rust, I can be certain that a change that compiles will be both free of   data races  (a prominent root cause of concurrency bugs) and   memory safe  (we remain for the most part on   safe Rust ). I can easily spot functions that may lead to a panic ‒ Rust’s way of aborting execution when there is no alternative ‒, spot useless memory copies and in general gather the developer’s intentions. Clippy, Rust’s   linter , helps unify code style and leads to a more idiomatic, consistent code base. I have reviewed thousands of merge requests these last two years with a much higher confidence than if it had been any other mainstream programming language.</p><p> 随着团队和代码基础的增长，有效审核代码的能力至关重要。 Rust非常显着，使行为非常明确，我的意思是没有必要思考系统的其他部分 - 当前功能通常足够。查看代码时，我们呈现出差异（已更改的线路和周围上下文），虽然人们可能需要更多的时间挖掘更改，更快的评论是可以快速获得反馈的开发人员的伟大动机。在Rust中，我可以确定编译的更改将是免费的数据比赛（并发突出的根本原因）和内存安全（我们仍然是安全生锈的大部分时间）。我可以轻松发现可能导致恐慌 - 生锈的中止执行方式的功能，当没有替代方案时，现货无用的内存副本和一般收集开发人员的意图。 Clippy，Rust的Linter，有助于统一代码风格，并导致更加惯用的，一致的代码库。我在过去两年中审查了数千个合并要求，比任何其他主流编程语言更高的置信度。</p><p> Rust is a large, complex language and it is easy to get lost in details. Fortunately, it is not necessary to know all the minute details to be efficient. It is our experience that Rust is an extremely productive language: it has great tooling, forces us to thoroughly model problems, saving precious debug time and potential production issues, and is great for code-reuse ‒ a productivity multiplier. Finally, I feel it is necessary to debunk the “  fighting the borrow checker ” legend, a story depicting the Rust compiler as a boogeyman: in my experience, it happens mostly to beginners and the 1% trying to micro-optimize code or push the boundaries. Most experienced Rust developers know exactly how to model their code in a way that no time is wasted fighting the compiler on design issues, and can spot anti-patterns at a glance, just like most people know how to drive their car on the correct side of the road to avoid accidents, and notice those who don’t!</p><p> Rust是一种大，复杂的语言，很容易迷失细节。幸运的是，无需了解所有微小的细节以效率。我们的经验是铁锈是一种极其富有成效的语言：它有很好的工具，迫使我们彻底模拟问题，节省珍贵的调试时间和潜在的产量问题，并且对于代码重用而言，生产力倍增器很棒。最后，我觉得有必要揭穿“战斗借书”传说，一个故事描绘了博彩代理人的逃避编译器：在我的经验中，它大多是初学者，1％试图微优化代码或推动边界。大多数经验丰富的Rust开发人员都知道如何以一种方式模拟代码，即任何时候没有浪费在设计问题上的编译器，并且可以一目了然地发现反模式，就像大多数人都知道如何在正确的一面驾驶他们的汽车避免事故的道路，并注意那些没有的人！</p><p>  During these two years, we have built the foundations of the modern Kraken backend stack, rewritten existing functionality to Rust, built new Rust services and features, and also built the Core Backend team of 30+ engineers. A few developers were originally hired as PHP developers and have learned Rust as they joined the team. It is worth mentioning that Kraken is a globally distributed remote-first company, and the Core Backend team has Engineers of 15 nationalities working from 12 countries.</p><p>  在这两年内，我们已经建立了现代克拉肯后端堆栈的基础，重写了现有的功能来生锈，建立新的Rust服务和功能，并建立了30+工程师的核心后端团队。一些开发人员最初被聘为PHP开发人员，并在加入团队时学会了生锈。值得一提的是，克朗登是一家全球分布式遥控公司，核心后端球队拥有从12个国家工作的15个国籍的工程师。</p><p> Rust attracts passionate developers, often interested in systems programming, distributed systems or cryptography. A good portion of our current Core Backend engineers are Rust enthusiasts who have discovered the opportunity through various Rust online resources, from Reddit to   This Week In Rust  where our job offers have been featured many times (thanks!), making Kraken somewhat known for hiring Rust developers for a long time.</p><p> Rust吸引了激情的开发人员，通常对系统编程，分布式系统或密码学感兴趣。我们目前的核心后端工程师的一部分是通过各种铁锈在线资源发现机会的铁锈爱好者，从Reddit到本周，我们的工作优惠很多次（谢谢！），使克拉肯闻名于招聘铁锈开发人员很长一段时间。 </p><p> Our Core Backend roles combine challenging technical and business problems in a very competitive market, remote working from all over the world with a high, location-independent base compensation and a generous option grant,   and  writing Rust almost full-time . This fact was not lost on the many candidates who have applied these two years and made it possible to build a world-class engineering team.</p><p>我们的核心后端角色将竞争激烈的市场中充满挑战的技术和业务问题结合在一起，在世界各地进行远程工作，并提供与位置无关的高额基本报酬和慷慨的选择权，并几乎全职撰写Rust。对于申请了这两年的许多候选人并没有失去这一事实，这使得组建世界一流的工程团队成为可能。</p><p> While we originally were open to hiring developers with interest but no hands-on experience in Rust, we have quickly realized it did not always pan out and that the learning curve depends on the individual. Interestingly, Rust attracts developers coming from very different languages, both statically and dynamically typed. It’s hard to say whether those coming from a specific background have a harder learning curve but some become effective in weeks while others still struggle after months. Those who are used to relying on documentation and have a formal understanding of semantics are most likely to catch up fast. Like many fast-growing companies, we need new hires to be able to help immediately on real issues. We thus require provable Rust experience and specifically test for a thorough understanding of Rust’s type system and practical knowledge of the standard library and common   crates .</p><p> 当我们最初对感兴趣的招聘开发人员敞开大门，但是对Rust却没有实际经验时，我们很快意识到它并不总是成功，学习曲线取决于个人。有趣的是，Rust吸引了来自非常不同的静态和动态类型语言的开发人员。很难说那些来自特定背景的人的学习曲线是否更难，但有些在几周内就可以生效，而另一些在数月后仍会挣扎。那些习惯于依赖文档并且对语义学有正式理解的人最有可能赶上。像许多快速发展的公司一样，我们需要新员工才能在实际问题上立即提供帮助。因此，我们需要可证明的Rust经验，并且需要进行测试，以便全面了解Rust的类型系统以及标准库和普通包装箱的实用知识。</p><p> I believe that using Rust helps one become a better developer as it pushes for clean design and precision. However, knowledge of Rust alone does not make one a great engineer. A lot of candidates we have seen are ecstatic about Rust, but have limited experience building backend systems. We have hired many junior developers showing great potential because when growing a team, balance is key to success. Experienced developers are often great mentors: they usually carry the wisdom of keeping things simple, have learned not to trust themselves too much, and how to maximize their impact on the business line.</p><p> 我相信使用Rust可以帮助人们成为更好的开发人员，因为它推动了简洁的设计和精度。但是，仅了解Rust并不能使他成为一名出色的工程师。我们看到的许多候选人对Rust都很满意，但是在构建后端系统方面经验有限。我们雇用了许多具有巨大潜力的初级开发人员，因为在组建团队时，平衡是成功的关键。经验丰富的开发人员通常是出色的导师：他们通常具有使事情简单的智慧，学会了不要过于信任自己，以及如何最大限度地发挥其对业务的影响。</p><p> Considering how the language resolves pain points with C++, Java or Go, I’d expect more seasoned developers to make the jump. Coming myself from a decade of Java development, I appreciate healthy skepticism for overhyped new technologies, yet I would now dread returning to a language that does not match Rust’s qualities ‒ in particular how it lets me focus on the module at hand, instead of needing to constantly consider a number of implicit invariants like whether that piece of code is called from another thread, and the fact I’d need to make it thread-safe. We hope that with more companies now heavily investing in Rust ‒ from Discord and Deliveroo to Amazon and Microsoft ‒ we can help send a signal that there are many Rust jobs and that investing time to learn the language will not go to waste. Many seasoned developers will prefer to remain on the stack they are experts in, but some may still love trying to get away from their comfort zone and challenge themselves.</p><p> 考虑到该语言如何解决C ++，Java或Go的痛点，我希望有更多经验丰富的开发人员能有所作为。我来自Java开发十多年，我对过度炒作的新技术表示怀疑，但是我现在害怕回到一种与Rust的品质不符的语言-特别是它如何让我专注于手头的模块，而不是需要不断考虑许多隐式不变式，例如该代码段是否从另一个线程调用，以及我需要使其成为线程安全的事实。我们希望，随着越来越多的公司现在从Discord和Deliveroo到亚马逊和微软more在Rust上进行大量投资，我们可以帮助发出一个信号，表明Rust的工作很多，并且花时间学习这种语言不会浪费。许多经验丰富的开发人员更愿意留在他们作为专家的堆栈上，但是有些人可能仍然喜欢尝试摆脱自己的舒适区并挑战自己。</p><p>  Rust has allowed us to build a lot of well-working, high performance production code. We have a large team where many people are working on very different parts of the backend. Most of that code has been incredibly robust: we have not experienced a single crash or   panic  (the rough equivalent of a   runtime exception ) of a Rust core service. All in all, I can say we only have had business logic issues, misconfiguration problems, and experienced a general performance issue linked to running Tokio on the   musl  libc with specific kernel configuration that was easily fixed once identified using the   perf  tool.</p><p>  Rust使我们能够构建许多运行良好的高性能生产代码。我们有一个庞大的团队，其中许多人在后端的非常不同的部分上工作。大多数代码都非常健壮：我们还没有经历过Rust核心服务的一次崩溃或恐慌（大致相当于运行时异常）。总而言之，我可以说我们仅遇到业务逻辑问题，配置错误问题，并且遇到了与在Musl libc上运行Tokio以及特定内核配置有关的一般性能问题，一旦使用perf工具确定了该问题，就可以轻松修复该问题。</p><p> While the language is great, there are a couple of things widely acknowledged as limitations that have bitten us as well.</p><p> 虽然语言很棒，但也有一些被广泛认为是局限性的事情也困扰着我们。</p><p> Ideally, each fallible function would have its own error   enum  to precisely capture its errors and handle them, but in practice it is too verbose and leads to using the less precise   Error  trait or one enum per module. The language could support this better: there are several initiatives and macros exploring this.</p><p> 理想情况下，每个易错函数都具有自己的错误枚举，以精确捕获其错误并进行处理，但实际上，它过于冗长，导致使用不太精确的错误特征或每个模块使用一个枚举。该语言可以更好地支持这一点：有许多倡议和宏对此进行了探索。 </p><p> When designing a library crate, the lack of   specialization  and   generic associated types  (GATs) can be quite limiting.</p><p>在设计库箱时，缺乏专业化和通用关联类型（GAT）可能会受到很大限制。</p><p> We have been using   async  Rust first with   Future  combinators and using the   async /  await  support as soon as it landed on   nightly . It’s been an extraordinary feature that let us build massively concurrent applications using Tokio. We never had to spend much time to make our servers handle more than 10K concurrent connections or implement back-pressure. However, it can still get better:</p><p> 我们首先将Future Rust组合器与async Rust配合使用，并在每晚登陆时使用async / await支持。这是一项非凡的功能，使我们可以使用Tokio构建大规模的并发应用程序。我们从不需要花费很多时间来使我们的服务器处理超过10K的并发连接或实施背压。但是，它仍然可以变得更好：</p><p> Unlike most parts of Rust,   async  functions are a bit of a footgun as they look innocuously similar to regular functions, but may not be executed entirely (more precisely, the   Future  they return may not be polled to completion). This requires extra carefulness to handle clean-up logic, which cannot currently be asynchronous itself. The ongoing work to support   asynchronous drop  will hopefully provide a piece of the solution. It’s still an open question on how to make the problems more visible; could an  attribute make it clear the   Future  is cancelation-safe and a lint warning tell us otherwise?</p><p> 与Rust的大多数部分不同，异步函数看起来有点像常规函数，但它们可能不会完全执行（更确切地说，它们返回的Future可能不会被轮询完成），因为它们看上去与常规函数无害。这需要格外小心，以处理清理逻辑，清理逻辑目前本身不能异步进行。正在进行的支持异步删除的工作有望提供一部分解决方案。如何使问题更明显仍是一个悬而未决的问题；属性可以清楚地表明Future是否可以安全取消，并且棉绒警告会告诉我们否则吗？</p><p> Though it is getting better, the ecosystem has been badly hurt by the split of asynchronous frameworks. The language would greatly benefit from providing the constructs that would allow task scheduling subsystems to be abstracted without overhead, so one may choose to use their favourite executor, and pass down task executors down to libraries, or drive the   Future  themselves.</p><p> 尽管情况越来越好，但异步框架的分裂已严重损害了生态系统。该语言将从提供的结构中受益匪浅，该结构将使任务调度子系统抽象而无需额外开销，因此人们可以选择使用自己喜欢的执行程序，并将任务执行程序传递给库，或者自行驱动Future。</p><p> The current design of statically initialized task executors makes it easy to run several executors by mistake by simply pulling a dependency. The generalized usage of thread locals makes debugging more difficult.</p><p> 静态初始化任务执行程序的当前设计使得通过简单地拉出依赖关系而容易地错误地运行多个执行程序。线程局部变量的普遍使用使调试更加困难。</p><p> Being able to design asynchronous functions in traits without boxing, and to refer to the result type, would definitely be a great improvement in performance-sensitive code .</p><p> 能够在特征中设计异步函数而无需装箱，并能够引用结果类型，这绝对是对性能敏感的代码的一项重大改进。</p><p> We are also hopeful to see work around   io-uring  result in great performance improvements hopefully without creating further splits of the ecosystem.</p><p> 我们也希望看到围绕ioing的工作有望带来巨大的性能改进，而又不会造成生态系统的进一步分裂。 </p><p> In terms of tooling, Cargo and Rustup have made setting up and compiling projects a non-concern. RustAnalyzer has improved spectacularly and provides a great IDE experience that will get even better. Compile times have generally reduced: they could be shorter but with incremental builds and   sccache  they aren’t too much of a time sink. Optimized builds are indeed slow, but overall a small price to pay for the performance and safety. A private Cargo registry with permissioning support would definitely help Rust in the enterprise. We have been running using   git  dependencies but the lack of semantic versioning support makes updates painful. There are a few open source Cargo registries out there, but Cargo itself does not support access tokens or credentials.  We’d love to sponsor that work.</p><p>在工具方面，Cargo和Rustup使得设置和编译项目变得无关紧要。 RustAnalyzer进行了惊人的改进，并提供了很棒的IDE体验，并且会变得更好。编译时间通常会减少：它们可能会更短，但是随着构建和sccache的增加，它们不会花费太多时间。优化的构建确实速度很慢，但是总体来说要付出很小的代价才能获得性能和安全性。具有许可支持的私人货运登记处一定会对Rust在企业中有所帮助。我们一直在使用git依赖项运行，但是缺少语义版本支持使更新很痛苦。那里有一些开源的Cargo注册中心，但是Cargo本身不支持访问令牌或凭证。我们很乐意赞助这项工作。</p><p>  All things considered, Rust is very mature and most of its pain points would exist in one shape or another in other mainstream languages. Rust makes reuse trivial and lets us deal safely with large code bases under active development without sacrificing performance.</p><p>  考虑到所有因素，Rust非常成熟，并且大多数痛点在其他主流语言中将以一种或另一种形式存在。 Rust使重用变得微不足道，并允许我们在主动开发下安全地处理大型代码库，而又不牺牲性能。</p><p> Using Rust is for us no longer an experiment or a bet. It is the proven technology we are building on, and the Core Backend team is looking for engineers to help. This picture would be incomplete without mentioning our team values beyond Rust: the Core Backend team extends Kraken’s culture ‒and the commitment to our mission‒ with the engineering values of Rust and a high-performance team culture   influenced by Netflix . We believe in engineering beyond code, in   ownership . We reject hubris. We constantly learn from each other. Our challenge is made greater by not sharing an office, and individuals who thrive are engineers able to move forward autonomously by being at the same time self-driven, deeply technical, able to bridge between requirements and technical solutions. We combine smart and hard work, but preserve a good work-life balance and stay healthy. We care about what we are building and help our teammates succeed.  We realize perfect is the enemy of good (Rust developers are notoriously perfectionists! 😉). Finally, we believe in constant self-improvement as a group: if something is broken, either technically or organizationally, we fix it.</p><p> 对我们而言，使用Rust不再是实验或赌注。这是我们正在建立的可靠技术，Core Backend团队正在寻求工程师的帮助。如果不提及Rust之外的团队价值观，这幅画是不完整的：Core Backend团队利用Rust的工程价值和受Netflix影响的高性能团队文化，扩展了Kraken的文化-以及对我们使命的承诺。我们相信超越代码的工程，拥有所有权。我们拒绝傲慢自大。我们不断相互学习。不共享办公室将使我们面临的挑战更加严峻，而蓬勃发展的个人则是工程师，他们能够自我驱动，技术精湛，能够在需求和技术解决方案之间架起桥梁，从而能够自主前进。我们将聪明和努力的工作结合在一起，但保持了良好的工作与生活平衡并保持健康。我们关心我们正在建设的东西，并帮助我们的队友取得成功。我们认识到完美是善的敌人（众所周知，铁锈开发人员是完美主义者！😉）。最后，我们相信团队会不断自我完善：如果技术或组织方面出现问题，我们会予以解决。</p><p> We have openings in the Core Backend team for   Mid-level  and   Senior Backend Engineers , as well as   Site Reliability Engineers  that help support and improv</p><p> 我们在核心后端团队中为中级和高级后端工程师以及有助于支持和改进的站点可靠性工程师提供了空缺</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.kraken.com/post/7964/oxidizing-kraken/">https://blog.kraken.com/post/7964/oxidizing-kraken/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/氧化/">#氧化</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/oxidizing/">#oxidizing</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/rust/">#rust</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
