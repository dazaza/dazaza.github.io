I wrote about the map-based Wordle game Worldle on Monday and I, for some reason, completely didn’t realize that it would work the same as Wordle and only offer one game a day. So, in my writeup of this fabulous game, I included a screenshot of Monday’s answer, thus spoiling the game for anyone who had not figured it out, yet. I am sorry for this. I am an idiot.</p><p>我想在今天的邮件中道歉！！我在周一写了一篇关于基于地图的Wordle游戏Worldle的文章，出于某种原因，我完全没有意识到它会和Wordle一样工作，每天只提供一个游戏。所以，在我写的这个精彩的游戏中，我加入了一个周一答案的截图，这样一来，对于那些还没有弄明白答案的人来说，游戏就被破坏了。我很抱歉。我是个白痴。</p><p>    I’ve spent the last few weeks putting together a small syllabus about the history of memes (obligatory plug: the remote course  starts next week), which has meant I’ve spent a lot of time going back and looking at what the internet was like between the years of 2002-2012. Because, it turns out, when you start to really trace back the cultural forces that shape the social web still to this day, most of them started during this period.</p><p>过去几周，我一直在整理一个关于模因历史的小教学大纲（必修课程：远程课程下周开始），这意味着我花了很多时间回顾2002-2012年间的互联网。因为，事实证明，当你开始真正追溯至今仍在塑造社交网络的文化力量时，大多数都是在这一时期开始的。</p><p> MySpace and 4chan launched in 2003 (within three months of each other, interestingly enough), then Digg launched in 2004, Reddit and YouTube in 2005, and Facebook in 2006. The first half of the 00s was, looking back at it, actually a nonstop flurry of online activity. But, things got a lot more interesting towards the end of the decade when MySpace was starting to die. And while putting a date on the actual death of a social network is difficult, for MySpace we do have a decent time range to approximate its demise. And I think comparing the site’s final years to where we are with Meta (Facebook) now is actually really fascinating.</p><p>MySpace和4chan于2003年推出（有趣的是，彼此相隔不到三个月），然后Digg于2004年推出，Reddit和YouTube于2005年推出，Facebook于2006年推出。回顾过去，00年代的前半段实际上是一场不间断的网络活动。但是，在MySpace开始消亡的那十年末，事情变得有趣多了。虽然很难确定社交网络的实际死亡日期，但对于MySpace来说，我们确实有一个合适的时间范围来估计它的死亡。我认为，将该网站的最后几年与我们现在使用Meta（Facebook）的情况进行比较真的很有意思。</p><p> At the end of 2007, according to Alexa rankings, MySpace was the biggest social network in the world. It had been sold to Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp for $580 million two years prior and was essentially the center of American pop culture. It was Fall Out Boy’s world and we were just living in it. But on June 13, 2008, Facebook  beat MySpace in unique visitors for the first time. There are lots of theories as to exactly why, but  the   LA Times  wrote in 2009 that it may have been due to the site’s reliance on what it called “portal strategy”:</p><p>根据Alexa排名，2007年底，MySpace是世界上最大的社交网络。两年前，它以5.8亿美元的价格卖给了鲁珀特·默多克的新闻集团，基本上是美国流行文化的中心。这是男孩的世界，我们只是生活在其中。但在2008年6月13日，Facebook首次在独特访客方面击败了MySpace。关于具体原因有很多理论，但《洛杉矶时报》在2009年写道，这可能是因为该网站依赖其所谓的“门户战略”：</p><p> The perceived missteps are numerous. Some observers say it clung too long to a “portal strategy,” in which it sought to amass an audience around entertainment content. By contrast, Facebook maintained its focus on features that enhance the social-networking experience, such as the “News Feed” that matches the immediacy of Twitter’s staccato updates.</p><p>人们察觉到的失误有很多。一些观察人士表示，该公司坚持“门户战略”的时间太长了，该战略试图围绕娱乐内容聚集受众。相比之下，Facebook仍然专注于增强社交网络体验的功能，比如与Twitter断音更新的即时性相匹配的“新闻提要”。</p><p> Which I think is right! Though I’m not sure the quote above fully conveys what late-era MySpace was like. By 2007, the site was synonymous with  hacks, scams, harassment, and even  murder. I distinctly remember pockets of MySpace that seemed to be entirely populated by Hot Topic employees, small town drug dealers, juggalos, and neo-Nazis (sometimes they were all the same account). And, until Facebook came around, there was a real sense that there was just simply nowhere else to go online. You’d clear out your MySpace notifications, click around aimlessly, and go back to AOL Instant Messenger, which is where you were talking to all the friends you had on MySpace anyways. I remember sitting in front of a MySpace dashboard, thinking to myself, “well, now what?” I, also, as a teenager, remembered feeling very weird when adults started showing up on the platform. So when I finally got access to Facebook, which required a school email to join, I was extremely excited to get away from whatever this was…</p><p>我认为这是对的！虽然我不确定上面的引语是否充分表达了MySpace时代晚期的样子。到2007年，该网站已成为黑客、诈骗、骚扰甚至谋杀的代名词。我清楚地记得，MySpace上似乎全是热门话题员工、小镇毒贩、juggalos和新纳粹分子（有时他们都是同一个账号）。而且，在Facebook出现之前，人们有一种真正的感觉，那就是没有其他地方可以上网。你可以清除MySpace通知，漫无目的地点击，然后返回AOL Instant Messenger，在那里你可以与MySpace上的所有朋友聊天。我记得我坐在MySpace的仪表板前，心里想，“好吧，现在怎么办？”一、 此外，作为一名青少年，我记得当成年人开始出现在平台上时，我感到非常奇怪。所以当我最终进入Facebook时，需要一封学校的电子邮件才能加入，我非常兴奋能摆脱这一切…</p><p>  It’s now difficult to really remember how weird the last days of MySpace were because it all happened in such a short period of time, but the company flailed around desperately for about a year and a half after Facebook overtook it in the Alexa rankings. It, at one point, briefly attempted to merge with Yahoo!, its corporate leadership changed continuously, and, most interestingly for us here in 2022, it launched a redesign that no one cared about and/or actively hated.</p><p>现在很难真正记得MySpace的最后几天有多奇怪，因为这一切都发生在这么短的时间内，但在Facebook在Alexa排名中超过它之后，该公司在大约一年半的时间里拼命挣扎。它曾一度试图与雅虎合并！，它的企业领导层不断变化，最有趣的是，对我们来说，2022年，它启动了一个没有人关心和/或积极讨厌的重新设计。</p><p> The 2010 MySpace redesign had a bunch of interesting features, however. It stressed “security” and “safety,” allowing users to toggle who could view their content, including a “friends only” option. It also gave users a Facebook-esque News Feed that recommended music and TV content. They changed their logo and dropped the “a place for friends” tagline. This was the era of the “My_____” name, remember? In fact, many of these features could almost be considered “ahead of their time.” Here’s a really fascinating quote from a  2010   Guardian  interview with Rebekah Horne, MySpace’s managing director for international:</p><p>然而，2010年MySpace的重新设计有一系列有趣的功能。它强调“安全”和“安全”，允许用户切换谁可以查看他们的内容，包括“仅限朋友”选项。它还为用户提供了一个类似Facebook的新闻提要，推荐音乐和电视内容。他们改变了自己的标志，并放弃了“朋友的地方”的标语。这是“我的”名字的时代，记得吗？事实上，这些功能中的许多几乎可以被认为是“超前的”以下是2010年《卫报》对MySpace国际业务董事总经理丽贝卡·霍恩（Rebekah Horne）的采访中一段非常精彩的话：</p><p> Rather than trying to compete with Facebook, this new look is about shifting away. &#34;This heralds a new direction… this connects the socialization of content, through the tools of the site, with people using the site across music, TV, gaming, celebrity gossip — it adds that social layer.&#34;</p><p>这种新的面貌不是试图与Facebook竞争，而是要改变&#34;这预示着一个新的方向……它通过网站的工具将内容的社会化与人们在音乐、电视、游戏、名人八卦等领域使用网站联系起来——它增加了社交层面&#34;</p><p> But as forward-thinking as some of this was, it all ended up being for nothing because social networks live and die by the quality of the, uh, social networking that’s happening on them. So, by early 2011, MySpace  had lost 10 million users in a single month.</p><p>但是，尽管其中一些是前瞻性的，但最终一切都是徒劳的，因为社交网络的生存和消亡取决于其上正在发生的社交网络的质量。因此，到2011年初，MySpace在一个月内就失去了1000万用户。</p><p> What’s so fascinating about looking back at all of this stuff is that, while there are some key differences, obviously, between where MySpace was in 2008 and where Facebook is in 2022 — MySpace never got big enough to warrant antitrust regulation, nor did emo kids successfully storm the Capitol (though, I’m sure they would have tried if they had gas money) — there are actually a lot more similarities.</p><p>回顾所有这些东西的有趣之处在于，虽然MySpace在2008年和Facebook在2022年的位置之间存在一些关键的差异，但MySpace从未变得足够大，足以支持反垄断监管，emo的孩子们也没有成功地闯入国会大厦（不过，我相信如果他们有汽油钱的话，他们会尝试的）——事实上有更多的相似之处。</p><p> MySpace was at the top of the world, largely thanks to its increasingly-consolidated portal strategy. Which meant there was really no way to shake the weirdos, grifters, (and Christian screamo bands, apparently) that eventually showed up and started making the site unusable. And then a new app promising a more exciting, more alive-feeling central feed launched, specifically targeting teenagers. As MySpace’s older users began feeling more stuck and bored there, younger users left in droves, until there were no new ones signing up at all anymore. And then MySpace announced a bizarre redesign, a dumb logo change, and a shifting of their corporate strategy that they claimed was not related to competing with the new successful social network, but, instead, was about connecting users with the content they love — though, in ways that no one actually cared about.</p><p>MySpace在世界上名列前茅，这在很大程度上要归功于其日益整合的门户战略。这意味着真的没有办法撼动那些最终出现并开始使网站无法使用的怪人、骗子（显然还有基督教尖叫乐队）。然后，一个新的应用程序推出了一个更令人兴奋、更具活力的中央订阅源，专门针对青少年。随着MySpace的老用户开始在那里感到更加困顿和无聊，年轻用户成群结队地离开，直到没有新用户注册为止。然后，MySpace宣布了一项奇怪的重新设计，一项愚蠢的徽标更改，以及他们公司战略的转变，他们声称这与与与新的成功社交网络的竞争无关，而是关于将用户与他们喜欢的内容联系起来——尽管，以没有人真正关心的方式。</p><p> Well, two days ago, Meta, which is what Facebook calls itself now for some reason,  tried to hold a post-Super Bowl Foo Fighters concert in its new VR platform that no one wants, but users couldn’t figure out how to actually access it and the ones that did said it looked like shit and sucked. Also, yesterday, Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook’s corporate values  now include the bizarre tagline “Meta, metamates, me.” And over on Instagram, Reels, the video feed on Meta’s once-cool photo app,  is filling up with silent auto-playing one-second video memes everyone hates. Meanwhile, TikTok’s owner ByteDance  reported last month that their 2021 sales grew by 70%. So, you know, you connect the dots there.</p><p>两天前，梅塔（Facebook出于某种原因称自己为梅塔）试图在其新的虚拟现实平台上举办一场超级碗后的Foo Fighters演唱会，但没有人想要，但用户不知道如何实际访问它，而且那些用户说它看起来很烂。此外，昨天，马克·扎克伯格（Mark Zuckerberg）宣布，Facebook的企业价值观现在包括奇怪的口号“Meta，metamates，me”而在Instagram上，Meta曾经很酷的照片应用程序上的视频源Reels则充斥着无声自动播放大家都讨厌的一秒钟视频迷因。与此同时，TikTok的老板Butt舞报道上个月他们的2021的销售额增长了70%。所以，你知道，你把这些点连在一起。</p><p>   The following is a paid ad.

We were the stereotypical black / white buddies and we would play this up. On Facebook, I would post screenshots from movies or TV shows, of ‘the time we went to med school’ (Turk and JD from  Scrubs), or a picture from  Lethal Weapon with the caption ‘When me and J became cops in the 80s.’ You get the idea. Everyone loved it.”</p><p>两天前，一个名为u/plumberoncrack的Reddit用户向r/movies发布了一个请求。他们写道：“请容忍我，我需要一个著名的电影截图，一个白人为一个死去的黑人哭泣……”。“在你拿起干草叉之前，我的朋友刚刚死了。我们是刻板的黑人/白人朋友，我们会把这一点发挥出来。在Facebook上，我会发布电影或电视节目的截图，关于‘我们上医学院的时间’（来自Scrubs的Turk和JD）或者是一张致命武器的照片，上面写着“当我和J在80年代成为警察时”你明白了。每个人都喜欢它。"</p><p> Then u/plumberoncrack explained that he wanted to honor the death of his friend by doing the bit one last time.</p><p>然后，u/P解释说，他想通过最后一次这样做来纪念他朋友的去世。</p><p> Look, I’m not really going to touch that whole thing because it’s actually pretty incidental to what happened next. The top comment on u/plumberoncrack’s post was from a user named u/YoyoDevo, who wrote that the term “bucket list” didn’t actually exist before the movie  The Bucket List came out in 2007.</p><p>听着，我真的不打算触及整件事，因为它实际上是接下来发生的事情的偶然事件。u/PenderonCrack帖子上的主要评论来自一个名为u/YoyoDevo的用户，他写道，在2007年电影《水桶清单》问世之前，“水桶清单”一词实际上并不存在。</p><p>  The comments underneath u/YoyoDevo’s comment are full of users claiming they remember already knowing the phrase before the movie came out. For what it’s worth, I think I remember a moment in the trailer where they explain the premise of a “bucket list,” but I also sort of remember already being familiar with the concept, as well.</p><p>在u/Yodevo的评论下面，有很多用户声称他们记得在电影上映前就已经知道了这个短语。值得一提的是，我想我记得在预告片中的一个时刻，他们解释了“桶清单”的前提，但我也记得我已经熟悉了这个概念。</p><p> Well, the debate about whether or not the movie  The Bucket List invented the term “bucket list” has spread across Reddit in the last few days, with other subreddits being sucked into the argument. Obviously the poor souls over at the r/MandelaEffect  had to weigh in, though, ironically, a lot of them claim they had never heard of it before the movie. Go figure. And r/SubredditDrama and r/todayilearned got involved, as well.</p><p>好吧，关于电影《桶清单》是否发明了“桶清单”一词的争论在过去几天已经在Reddit上蔓延开来，其他子Reddit也被卷入了这场争论。显然，在r/MandelaEffect的那些可怜的灵魂们不得不参与进来，不过，讽刺的是，他们中的许多人声称他们在电影之前从未听说过这部电影。想想看，r/Subreddit戏剧和r/TodayiLearn也参与其中。</p><p> Thankfully, the r/etymology subreddit  did some digging and put together what seems like a pretty likely explanation. Before the film came out, articles began circulating promoting it and explaining what a “bucket list” was. Though, apparently, it was already a concept, but it was usually called a “life list”.</p><p>谢天谢地，r/词源子Reddit做了一些挖掘，并整理了一个似乎很有可能的解释。在这部电影上映之前，一些文章开始流传，宣传这部电影，并解释什么是“遗愿清单”。虽然，很明显，这已经是一个概念，但它通常被称为“生命清单”。</p><p>    This is a request from a reader named Jeremy. Two days ago, a skincare influencer named Ryan Dubs  posted a vlog on TikTok about how he spends “$2,000 a month on water” and showed a video of his fridge, which is full of bottles of VOSS water. I was only vaguely familiar with VOSS water, but apparently it’s a Norwegian water brand that comes in still and sparkling.</p><p>这是一位名叫杰里米的读者的请求。两天前，一位名叫瑞安·杜布斯（Ryan Dubs）的护肤影响者在TikTok上发布了一条关于他如何“每月花2000美元买水”的视频，并展示了他冰箱的视频，冰箱里装满了几瓶沃斯水。我对VOSS water只是略知一二，但很显然，它是一个挪威的水品牌，在这里依然闪闪发光。</p><p> “It’s honestly a fashion accessory at this point,” Dubs wrote in the caption.</p><p>“在这一点上，它确实是一件时尚配饰，”杜布斯在标题中写道。</p><p> This is, of course, objectively nuts. I mean, do I drink sometimes two big bottles of sparkling water a day? Yes, but usually it’s like Polar brand and it costs like $1 each. And I don’t even think this guy is drinking sparkling water! I think he’s spending $2,000 a month on normal water! It doesn’t even have bubbles!</p><p>当然，这在客观上是疯狂的。我是说，有时候我一天喝两大瓶汽水吗？是的，但通常它就像Polar品牌，每个售价1美元。我甚至不认为这家伙在喝汽水！我想他每月花2000美元买普通水！它甚至没有气泡！</p><p>    On Monday, a Spanish-speaking Twitter user went viral — in the bad, but funny way — for asking why the character Aloy from the video game  Horizon Zero Dawn “had a beard”. The Twitter user used a red circle to highlight Aloy’s “beard”.</p><p>周一，一位说西班牙语的推特用户问视频游戏《地平线零点黎明》中的角色阿洛伊为什么“留胡子”，这一问题很糟糕，但很有趣。这位Twitter用户用一个红色圆圈来突出阿洛伊的“胡子”。</p><p> As I said, the tweet with super viral. It’s been quote-tweeted almost 13,000 times, which is an incredible ratio. It’s also spawned a ton of memes making fun of the whole thing. Here’s a  good Twitter search if you want to check out the dunking that’s happening, but here’s my favorite one:</p><p>正如我所说，这条推特病毒性很强。它被推特转发了近13000次，这是一个令人难以置信的比率。它还催生了大量的模因，取笑整件事。如果你想查看正在发生的扣篮，这里有一个不错的Twitter搜索，但这里是我最喜欢的一个：</p><p>     Guy Fieri has a TikTok, which shouldn’t be that surprising, but what is surprising is that he’s  posting moody videos on it set to Phoebe Bridgers songs. Now, to be clear, I’m absolutely positive that Guy Fieri did not post this himself on TikTok. His channel on the app is full of videos that are clearly made by some kind of social media manager. But, this Phoebe Bridgers one has been watched over 8 million times now, which means it’s absolutely gone viral enough for Fieri’s social team to have to explain it to him. And that, my friends, is what Flavortown is all about.&#34;</p><p>盖伊·费里（Guy Fieri）有一个TikTok，这应该没那么令人惊讶，但令人惊讶的是，他在上面发布了以菲比·布里奇斯（Phoebe Bridgers）的歌曲为背景的穆迪视频。现在，要明确的是，我绝对肯定盖伊·费里没有在TikTok上发布这篇文章。他在应用程序上的频道充满了视频，这些视频显然是由某种社交媒体经理制作的。但是，菲比·布里奇斯的这部电影现在已经被观看了800多万次，这意味着它已经完全疯了，菲里的社交团队不得不向他解释。朋友们，这就是香料城的意义所在&#34;</p><p>    I’ve  written about hose plinko before, but if you’ve missed this, basically, a 2017 3D simulation of a horse inside of a plinko machine went viral on Tumblr over the last few months. lol I bet you thought it would be LESS confusing if you knew what I was talking about, didn’t you?</p><p>我以前写过关于hose plinko的文章，但如果你错过了这一点，基本上，2017年plinko机器内部的马的3D模拟在过去几个月在Tumblr上迅速传播。哈哈，我打赌你认为如果你知道我在说什么的话，就不会那么困惑了，不是吗？</p><p> Well, after months of building hype around horse plinko, one of the researchers responsible for the original collision simulation that kicked off the meme, Rahul Narain, actually jumped into the YouTube comments to address horse plinko’s popularity.</p><p>好吧，在围绕马·普林科进行了数月的炒作之后，一位研究人员，负责最初的碰撞模拟，开启了这一迷因，拉胡尔·纳兰，实际上跳到了YouTube上的评论中，以表达马·普林科的受欢迎程度。</p><p> “Remember kids, stay in school and go into academic research, and maybe someday you too can find that a goofy video you made to demonstrate your technical contributions got turned into a meme when you weren&#39;t looking,” Narain wrote. “(All credit to my students George Brown and Matt Overby, especially George who spent multiple tries getting the horse to fall in an interesting way down the plinko machine)”</p><p>纳兰写道：“记住孩子们，呆在学校里进行学术研究，也许有一天你也会发现，当你不看的时候，你为展示自己的技术贡献而制作的一段愚蠢的视频变成了迷因。”。（这要归功于我的学生乔治·布朗和马特·奥弗比，尤其是乔治，他花了多次尝试让马以一种有趣的方式从普林科机器上摔下来。）</p><p>     Click through on this tweet to see a bunch of good ones. Wow, there’s something really retro about a big thread of Putin photoshops, right?</p><p>点击这条推文可以看到很多好的推文。哇，普京的一大串Photoshop真的很复古，对吧？</p><p>    OK, so guys, I really can’t get this out of my head. I have watched different versions of this clip at least a dozen times today trying to make sure this is real and not some elaborate YouTube conspiracy. But I think it is real. I think this is a real thing that happened. During a 1994 episode of the animated  Fantastic Four series, Johnny Storm performs… a rap song? That is, honestly, a total banger. He, and the rest of the Fantastic Four, are then kidnapped by mole people immediately after he finishes the song. The clip is an absolute fever dream. But also I want the stems to this beat because it is great.</p><p>好了，伙计们，我真的想不起来了。今天，我至少看了十几次这段视频的不同版本，试图确保这是真实的，而不是一些精心策划的YouTube阴谋。但我认为这是真的。我认为这是真实发生的事情。在1994年的动画片《神奇四侠》系列中，约翰尼·斯托姆表演了一首说唱歌曲？说实话，这真是太棒了。他，以及《神奇四侠》中的其他人，在他唱完这首歌后立即被鼹鼠绑架。这段视频绝对是一场狂热的梦。但我也希望茎部能跟上这个节拍，因为它很棒。</p><p>    I did not know that I wanted to watch hypnotic videos of a dude making rugs based on anime characters, but apparently it’s the kind of content that triggers the ASMR part of my brain that also likes watching that one guy on Instagram make elaborate sculptures out of chocolate. S Class Supply is a rug designer with over 700,000 followers on TikTok. His rugs are great! I would like to buy several. And  his videos making them are even more fun.</p><p>我不知道我想看一个家伙根据动漫人物制作地毯的催眠视频，但显然是这种内容触发了我大脑中的ASMR部分，也喜欢看Instagram上的一个人用巧克力制作精致的雕塑。S Class Supply是一家地毯设计师，在TikTok上拥有70多万粉丝。他的地毯很棒！我想买几个。他的视频制作更有趣。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button
