The iPad lineup, especially the larger iPad Pro, has kept up an impressively frantic pace of hardware innovation over the past few years. In that same time frame, the software of the iPad, especially its ability to allow users to use multiple apps at once and in its onramps for professional software makers, has come under scrutiny for an apparently slower pace.</p><p>今年WWDC会议上新iPad软件的宣布对其进行了异常大的期望。 iPad阵容，尤其是较大的iPad Pro，在过去几年中一直令人印象深刻的硬件创新速度。在同一时间框架中，iPad的软件，尤其是允许用户一次和在其Ondramps中使用多个应用程序的专业软件制造商的能力，这已经审查了显然较慢的速度。</p><p> This year’s announcements about iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 seemed designed to counter that narrative with the introduction of a broad number of quality of life improvements to multitasking as well as a suite of system-wide features that nearly all come complete with their own developer-facing APIs to build on. I had the chance to speak to Bob Borchers, Apple’s VP of Worldwide Product Marketing, and Sebastien (Seb) Mariners-Mes, VP, Intelligent System Experience at Apple about the release of iPadOS 15 to discuss a variety of these improvements.</p><p> 今年关于iOS 15和iPados 15的公告似乎旨在将叙述引入了广泛的生活质量改进了多任务处理以及一系列系统范围的功能，几乎全部与他们自己的开发人员面对完整建立的API。我有机会与鲍勃·博尔赫斯，苹果公司副总裁的鲍勃·博尔赫和Sebastien（Seb）Mariners-Mes，VP，智能系统经验，苹果公司有关iPados 15的发布，讨论各种这些改进。</p><p> Mariners-Mes works on the team of Apple software SVP Craig Federighi and was pivotal in the development of this new version.</p><p> Mariners-MES在苹果软件SVP Craig Federighi团队上工作，并在这个新版本的发展中得到了关键。</p><p>  iPad has a bunch of new core features including SharePlay, Live Text, Focuses, Universal Control, on-device Siri processing and a new edition of Swift Playgrounds designed to be a prototyping tool. Among the most hotly anticipated for iPad Pro users, however, are improvements to Apple’s multitasking system.</p><p>  iPad具有一堆新的核心功能，包括分数展，直播文本，专注，通用控制，设备上的Siri处理以及新版本的Swift游乐场，旨在成为原型工具。然而，对于iPad Pro用户最热烈预期的是Apple的多任务系统的改进。</p><p> If you’ve been following along, you’ll know that the gesture-focused multitasking interface of iPadOS has had its  share of critics, including me. Though it can be useful in the right circumstances, the un-discoverable gesture system and confusing hierarchy of the different kinds of combinations of apps made it a sort of floppy affair to utilize correctly for an  apt user much less a beginner.</p><p> 如果您一直在关注，您将知道iPados的姿态聚焦多任务界面已有其批评者，包括我。虽然它在合适的情况下很有用，但是未发现的手势系统和应用程序的不同类型组合的令人困惑的层次结构使其成为一种易于使用的软盘缺陷，以便用户更少地初学者。</p><p> Since the iPad stands alone as pretty much the only successful tablet device on the market, Apple has a unique position in the industry to determine what kinds of paradigms are established as standard. It’s a very unique opportunity to say, hey, this is what working on a device like this feels like; looks like; should be.</p><p> 由于iPad独立于市场上唯一成功的平板电脑设备，因此苹果在行业中具有独特的地位，以确定什么类型的范式标准。这是一个非常独特的机会，嘿，这就是这样对待这样的设备的机会，感觉如;好像;应该。</p><p>  So I ask Borchers and Mariners-Mes to talk a little bit about multitasking. Specifically Apple’s philosophy in the design of multitasking on iPadOS 15 and the update from the old version, which required a lot of acrobatics of the finger and a strong sense of spatial awareness of objects hovering out off the edges of the screen.</p><p>  所以我问Borchers和Mariners-MES谈论多任务处理。特别是Apple在iPados 15上设计了多任务处理的哲学和旧版本的更新，这需要了许多手指的杂技和悬停在屏幕边缘的物体的强烈空间意识感。 </p><p> “I think you’ve got it,” Borchers says when I mention the spatial gymnastics, “but the way that we think about this is that the step forward and multitasking makes it easier discover, easier to use even more powerful. And, while pros I think were the ones who were using multitasking in the past, we really want to take it more broadly because we think there’s applicability to many, many folks. And that’s why the, the discovery and the ease of use I think were critical.”</p><p>“我觉得你已经得到了，”博赫斯说，当我提到空间体操时，“但我们认为这一点是前进和多任务的方式使得它更容易发现，更容易使用更强大的功能。而且，虽然我认为过去的专业人士在过去使用多任务处理的同时，我们真的希望更广泛地拍摄它，因为我们认为对许多人的适用性，很多人。这就是为什么我认为的发现和易用性都很重要。“</p><p> “You had a great point there when you talked about the spatial model and one of our goals was to actually make the spatial model more explicit in the experience,” says Mariners-Mes, “where, for example, if you’ve got a split view, and you’re replacing one of the windows, we kind of open the curtain and tuck the other app to the side, you can see it — it’s not a hidden hidden mental model, it’s one that’s very explicit.</p><p> “当你谈到空间模型和我们的目标之一时，你有一个很棒的观点，它实际上使空间模型更明确的经验，”马林斯 -  MES说：例如，如果你有一个拆分视图，你更换了一个窗户，我们有点打开窗帘并将另一个应用程序塞到一边，你可以看到它 - 这不是一个隐藏的隐藏心理模型，这是一个非常明确的隐藏隐藏的心理模型。</p><p> Another great example of it is when you go into the app, switcher to reconfigure your windows, you’re actually doing drag and drop as you rearrange your new split views, or you dismiss apps and so on. So it’s not a hidden model, it’s one where we really try to reinforce a spatial model with an explicit one for the user through all of the animations and all of the kinds of affordances.”</p><p> 另一个很大的例子是当您进入应用程序时，切换器重新配置Windows，您实际上在重新排列新的拆分视图时执行拖放，或者您卸下应用程序等。所以它不是一个隐藏的模型，它是我们真正尝试用所有动画和所有动画和所有各种各样的人都有一个明确的空间模型来加强空间模型的模型。“</p><p>  Apple’s goal this time around, he says, was to add affordances for the user to understand that multitasking was even an option — like the small series of dots at the top of every app and window that now allows you to explicitly choose an available configuration, rather than the app-and-dock-juggling method of the past. He goes on to say that consistency was a key metric for them on this version of the OS. The appearance of Slide Over apps in the same switcher view as all other apps, for instance. Or the way that you can choose configurations of apps via the button, by drag and drop in the switcher and get the same results.</p><p>  他说，苹果的目标是，他说，这是为了为用户提供可供选择的人，了解多任务处理甚至是一个选项 - 就像每个应用程序和窗口顶部的小系列点一样，现在允许您明确选择可用配置，过去的应用程序和码头杂耍方法。他继续说，一致性是他们在这个版本的操作系统上的关键指标。例如，在相同的切换器视图中将应用程序的幻灯片视为所有其他应用。或者您可以通过按钮选择应用程序配置的方式，通过拖放切换器拖放并获得相同的结果。</p><p> In the dashboard, Mariners-Mes says, “you get an at a glance view of all of the apps that you’re running and a full model of how you’re navigating that through the iPad’s interface.”</p><p> 在仪表板中，Mariners-Mes说：“你可以一目了然地查看你正在运行的所有应用程序以及通过ipad的界面来导航的完整模型。”</p><p> This ‘at a glance’ map of the system should be very welcome by advanced users. Even as a very aggressive Pro user myself, Slide Over apps became more of a nuisance than anything because I couldn’t keep track of how many were open and when to use them. The ability to combine them on the switcher itself is one of those things that Apple has wanted to get into the OS for years but is just now making its way onto iPads. Persistence of organization, really, was the critical problem to tackle.</p><p> 通过高级用户应该非常欢迎系统的“一目了然”。即使作为一个非常激进的专业用户自己，幻灯片也比任何东西变得更加滋扰，因为我无法跟踪有多少开放，何时使用它们。将它们组合在切换器本身的能力是苹果公司希望进入OS的事情之一，但刚刚进入iPad。组织的持久性，真的是解决的危急问题。</p><p> “I think we believe strongly in building a mental model where people know where things are [on iPad],” says Mariners-Mes. “And I think you’re right when it comes persistence I think it also applies to, for example, home screen. People have a very strong mental model of where things are in the home screen as well as all of the apps that they’ve configured. And so we try to maintain a well maintained that mental model, and also allow people to reorganize again in the switcher.”</p><p> “我认为我们相信建立一个心理模型，人们知道事情是[在iPad]的地方，”马林斯 -  MES说。 “当它持久性时，我认为你是对的，我认为它也适用于例如主屏幕。人们有一个非常强大的心理模型，在家庭屏幕中的位置以及他们配置的所有应用程序。因此，我们试图维持一个良好的心理模型，并且还允许人们在切换器中再次重新组织。“ </p><p> He goes on to explain the new ‘shelf’ feature that displays every instance or window that an app has open within itself. They implemented this as a per-app feature rather than a system-wide feature, he says, because the association of that shelf with a particular app fit the overall mental model that they’re trying to build. The value of this shelf may jump into higher relief when more professional apps that may have a dozen documents or windows open at once and active during a project ship later this year.</p><p>他继续解释了新的“货架”功能，它显示了应用程序在本身内开放的每个实例或窗口。他说，他们将其作为每个应用程序特征而不是系统范围的功能，因为该货架与特定应用程序的关联适合他们试图构建的整体心理模型。当可能在今年晚些时候在项目发货时，可能有十几个文件或Windows的更多专业应用程序，此货架的值可能会跳跃更高的浮雕。</p><p>  Another nod to advanced users in iPadOS 15 is the rich keyboard shortcut set offered across the system. The interface can be navigated by arrow keys now, many advanced commands are there and you can even move around on an iPad using a game controller.</p><p>  IPADOS 15中的高级用户的另一个点头是整个系统提供的丰富的键盘快捷键集。界面现在可以通过箭头键导航，在那里有许多高级命令，您甚至可以使用游戏控制器在iPad上移动。</p><p> “One of the key goals this year was to make basically everything in the system navigable from the keyboard,” says Mariners-Mes, “so that if you don’t want to, you don’t have to take your hands off the keyboard. All of the new multitasking affordances and features, you can do through the keyboard shortcuts. You’ve got the new keyboard shortcut menu bar where you can see all the shortcuts that are available. It’s great for discoverability. You can search them and we even, you know, and this is a subtle point, but we even made a very conscious effort to rationalize the shortcuts across Mac and iPadOS. So that if you’re using universal control, for example, you’re going to go from one environment to the other seamlessly. You want to ensure that consistency as you go across.”</p><p> “今年的一个主要目标是基本上从键盘中导航的系统中的一切，”马林斯 -  MES说：“如果你不想，你不必把手从键盘上脱掉。所有新的多任务处理带电和功能，您都可以通过键盘快捷方式进行。您已收到新的键盘快捷菜单栏，您可以在其中查看可用的所有快捷方式。这是可发现性的伟大。您可以搜索它们，我们甚至，您也知道，这是一个微妙的观点，但我们甚至非常有意识地努力在Mac和iPados上合理化快捷方式。因此，如果您使用的通用控制，例如，您将无缝地从一个环境从一个环境。你想确保你遇到的一致性。“</p><p> The gestures, however, are staying as a nod to consistency for existing users that may be used to those.</p><p> 然而，手势被视为点头，以对可用于这些的现有用户的一致性。</p><p>  To me, one of the more interesting and potentially powerful developments is the introduction of the Center Window and its accompanying API. A handful of Apple apps like Mail, Notes and Messages now allow items to pop out into an overlapping window.</p><p>  对我来说，一个更有趣和潜在的强大的发展之一是引入中心窗口及其伴随的API。少数Apple应用程序，如邮件，注释和消息现在允许物品弹出到重叠窗口中。</p><p> “It was a very deliberate decision on our part,” says Mariners-Mes about adding this new element. “This really brings a new level of productivity where you can have, you know, this floating window. You can have content behind it. You can seamlessly cut and paste. And that’s something that’s just not possible with the traditional [iPadOS] model. And we also really strive to make it consistent with the rest of multitasking where that center window can also become one of the windows in your split view, or full size, and then go back to to being a center window. We think it’s a cool addition to the model and we look really look forward to 3rd parties embracing it.”</p><p> “这是一部分刻意的决定，”加入这个新元素的Mariners-MES说。 “这真的带来了一种新的生产力，您可以知道，您知道这个浮动窗口。你可以背后的内容。你可以无缝剪切和粘贴。这是传统的[iPados]模型中的事情。我们也真的努力使其与其余的多任务处理一致，在那里该中心窗口也可以成为拆分视图中的窗口之一，或者全尺寸，然后返回为中心窗口。我们认为这是模型的一个很酷的补充，我们看起来真的期待着第三方拥抱它。“</p><p> Early reception of the loop Apple gave at iPadOS 15 has an element of reservation about it still given that many of the most powerful creative apps are made by third parties that must adopt these technologies in order for them to be truly useful. But Apple, Borchers says, is working hard to make sure that pro apps adopt as many of these new paradigms and technologies as possible, so that come fall, the iPad will feel like a more hospitable host for the kinds of advanced work pros want to do there.</p><p> Loop Apple的早期接收在iPados 15上给出了一个关于它的预约元素，仍然给出了许多最强大的创意应用程序由必须采用这些技术的第三方，以便他们真正有用。但是，苹果公司说，努力确保专业应用程序尽可能多地采用这些新的范例和技术，因此来跌倒，iPad将觉得对各种先进工作特色的举办众多的主持人在那里。 </p><p> One of the nods to this multi-modal universe that the iPad exists in is Universal Control. This new feature uses Bluetooth beaconing, peer-to-peer WiFi and the iPad’s touchpad support to allow you to place your devices close to one another and — in a clever use of reading user intent — slide your mouse to the edge of a screen and onto your Mac or iPad seamlessly.</p><p>该多模态宇宙的一个点头是iPad存在于普遍控制中。这项新功能使用蓝牙信标，对等WiFi和iPad的触摸板支持，以允许您将设备彼此接近，巧妙地使用阅读用户意图 - 将鼠标滑入屏幕边缘和屏幕边缘无缝地进入Mac或iPad。</p><p>  “I think what we have seen and observed from our users, both pro and and otherwise, is that we have lots of people who have Macs and they have iPads, and they have other iPhones and and we believe in making these things work together in ways that are that are powerful,” says Borchers. “And it just felt like a natural place to be able to go and extend our Continuity model so that you could make use of this incredible platform that is iPadOS while working with your Mac, right next to it. And I think the big challenge was, how do you do that in kind of a magical, simple way. And that’s what Seb and his team and been able to accomplish.</p><p>  “我认为我们的用户都看到和观察到了我们的用户，而且，我们有很多人拥有MAC，他们有iPad，他们有其他iPhone，我们相信让这些事情融合在一起这是一种强大的方式，“博赫斯说。 “它只是觉得可以走出自然的地方，并扩展我们的连续性模型，以便您可以使用这种令人难以置信的平台，同时使用Mac，它在它旁边工作。而且我认为这是一个很大的挑战是，你如何以一种神奇，简单的方式做到这一点。这就是SEB和他的团队，并且能够实现。</p><p> “It really builds on the foundation we made with Continuity and Sidecar,” adds Mariners-Mes. “We really thought a lot about how do you make the experience — the set up experience — as seamless as possible. How do you discover that you’ve got devices side by side.?</p><p> “它真正建立在我们用连续性和侧幕制造的基础上，”加工Mariners-Mes。 “我们真的想到了很多关于你如何实现经验 - 建立经验 - 尽可能无缝。你如何发现你并排有设备。？</p><p> The other thing we thought about was what are the workflows that people want to have and what capabilities that will be essential for that. That’s where thinks like the ability to seamlessly drag content across the platforms or cut and paste was we felt to be really, really important. Because I think that’s really what brings to the magic to the experience.”</p><p> 我们想到的另一件事是人们想要拥有的工作流程以及哪些能力对此至关重要。那就是认为能够在平台上无缝拖动内容的能力或剪切和粘贴我们认为真的很重要。因为我认为这真的是为经验带来魔力的原因。“</p><p> Borchers adds that it makes all the continuity features that much more discoverable. Continuity’s shared clipboard, for instance, is an always on but invisible presence. Expanding that to visual and mouse-driven models made some natural sense.</p><p> Borchers补充说，它使所有的连续性特征都更加可发现。例如，连续性的共享剪贴板是总是在但不可见的存在。扩展到视觉和鼠标驱动的模型产生了一些自然意义。</p><p> “It’s just like, oh, of course, I can drag that all the way across all the way across here,” he says.</p><p> “就像哦，当然，我可以在这里一路拖动这一切，”他说。</p><p> “Bob, you say, of course,” Mariners-Mes laughs. “And yet for those of us working in platforms for a long time, the ‘of course’, is technically very, very challenging. Totally non obvious.”</p><p> “鲍勃，你当然说，”马林斯 - 梅斯笑了。 “然而，对于我们在平台上工作了很长时间的人，”当然“在技术上非常非常具有挑战性。完全不明显。“ </p><p> Another area where iPadOS 15 is showing some promising expansionary behavior is in system-wide activities that allow you to break out of the box of in-app thinking. These include embedded recommendations that seed themselves into various apps, Shareplay, which makes an appearance wherever video calls are found and Live Text, which turns all of your photos into indexed archives searchable with a keyboard.</p><p>iPados 15显示一些有前途的扩展行为的另一个领域是在系统范围的活动中，允许您突破应用程序内思维的框。这些包括嵌入式建议将自己种植到各种应用程序，分享，这是在找到视频呼叫的情况下以及实时文本的情况下，将所有照片转换为可用键盘可搜索的索引存档。</p><p> Another is Quick Note, a system extension that lets you swipe from the bottom corner of your screen wherever you are in the system.</p><p> 另一个是快速注意，一个系统扩展，让您在系统中屏幕的底部滑动。</p><p> “There are, I think a few interesting things that we did with with Quick Note,” says Mariners-Mes. “One is this idea of linking. So, that if I’m working in Safari or Yelp or another app, I can quickly insert a link to whatever content I’m viewing. I don’t know about you, but it’s something that I certainly do a lot when I do research.</p><p> “有的话，我认为我们用快速注释的一些有趣的事情，”马林斯 -  MES说。 “一个是这种链接的想法。因此，如果我在Safari或Yelp或其他应用程序中工作，我可以快速插入一个我正在查看的内容。我不了解你，但是当我做研究时，我当然会做很多事情。</p><p> “The old way was, like, cut and paste and maybe take a screenshot, create a note and jot down some notes. And now we’ve made that very, very seamless and fluid across the whole system. It even works the other way where, if I’m now in Safari and I have a note that refers to that page in Safari, you’ll see it revealed as a thumbnail at the bottom of the screen’s right hand side. So, we’ve really tried to bring the notes experience to be something that just permeates the system and is easily accessible from, from everywhere.”</p><p> “旧的方式，就像，剪切和粘贴，也许拍摄截图，创造一个音符并击落一些笔记。现在我们在整个系统中制作了非常非常无缝和流体。它甚至可以在另一种方式工作，如果我现在处于Safari，我有一个注释是指Safari中的那个页面，你会看到它在屏幕右侧的底部显示为缩略图。所以，我们真的试图带来笔记经验，这是一个只渗透系统的东西，并且从到处都可以轻松访问。“</p><p>  Many of the system-wide capabilities that Apple is introducing in iPadOS 15 and iOS 15 have an API that developers can tap into. That is not always the case with Apple’s newest toys, which in years past have often been left to linger in the private section of its list of frameworks rather than be offered to developers as a way to enhance their apps. Borchers says that this is an intentional move that offers a ‘broader foundation of intelligence’ across the entire system.</p><p>  Apple在iPados 15和iOS 15中引入的许多系统范围功能都有一个API，开发人员可以挖掘。苹果最新玩具的情况并非总是如此，过去已经过去常常被留在其框架名单列表中的私人科中，而不是为开发人员提供加强应用程序的一种方式。 Borchers表示，这是一个有意的举措，为整个系统提供了“更广泛的智力基础”。</p><p> This broader intelligence includes Siri moving a  ton of commands to its local scope. This involved having to move a big chunk of Apple’s speech recognition to an on-device configuration in the new OS as well. The results, says Borchers, are a vastly improved day-to-day Siri experience, with many common commands executing immediately upon request — something that was a bit of a dice roll in days of Siri past. The removal of the reputational hit that Siri was taking from commands that went up to the cloud never to return could be the beginning of a turnaround for the public perception of Siri’s usefulness.</p><p> 这种更广泛的情报包括Siri将一大吨命令移动到其本地范围。这涉及必须将Apple的语音识别大块移动到新操作系统中的设备上配置。结果说，博尔彻师是一个大大改善的日常Siri经验，许多常见命令立即执行，在请求时立即执行 - 在Siri过去几天有点骰子滚动。删除了Siri从未返回的命令从未返回的命令中删除了，这可能是公众对Siri的有用性的公众感知的转变的开始。</p><p> The on-device weaving of the intelligence provided by the Apple Neural Engine (ANE) also includes the indexing of text across photos in the entire system, past, present and in-the-moment.</p><p> Apple神经发动机（ANE）提供的智能的设备编织还包括整个系统中的照片中的文本的索引，过去，现在和当时的照片。 </p><p> “We could have done live text only in camera and photos, but we wanted it to apply to anywhere we’ve got images, whether it be in in Safari or quick look or wherever,” says Mariners-Mes. “One of my favorite demos of live text is actually when you’ve got that long complicated field for a password for a Wi-Fi network. You can just actually bring it up within the keyboard and take a picture of it, get the text in it and copy and paste it into into the field. It’s one of those things that’s just kind of magical.”</p><p>“我们本可以只在相机和照片中完成LIVE文本，但我们希望它申请到任何我们收到图像的任何地方，无论是在野生动物园还是快速外观或无论何处，”Mariners-Mes说。 “我最喜欢的LIVE文本演示之一实际上是当您对Wi-Fi网络的密码进行了长期复杂的字段时。您可以实际上可以在键盘中置于键盘中并拍摄它的照片，获取它中的文本并将其复制并粘贴到现场。这是那些只是神奇的东西之一。“</p><p> On the developer service front of iPadOS 15, I ask specifically about Swift Playgrounds, which add the ability to write, compile and ship apps on the App Store for the first time completely on iPad. It’s not the native Xcode some developers were hoping for, but, Borchers says, Playgrounds has moved beyond just ‘teaching people how to code’ and into a real part of many developer pipelines.</p><p> 在iPados 15的开发人员服务前，我专门向Swift Playground询问，它可以在iPad上完全完全在App Store上写入，编译和运送应用程序。这不是一些开发人员希望的原生Xcode，但是，Borchers说，游乐场已经超越了“教人们如何编码”并进入许多开发人员管道的真正部分。</p><p> “ think one of the big insights here was that we also saw a number of kind of pro developers using it as a prototyping platform, and a way to be able to be on the bus, or in the park, or wherever if you wanted to get in and give something a try, this was super accessible and easy way to get there and could be a nice adjunct to hey, I want to learn to code.”</p><p> “这在此处认为，我们还看到了许多使用它作为原型平台的专业开发人员，以及能够在公共汽车上或在公园上的方式，或者如果你想要的那样进入并尝试一下，这是超级访问和容易到达那里的方法，可能是嘿，我想学习代码。“</p><p> “If you’re a developer,” adds Mariners-Mes, “it’s actually more productive to be able to run that app on the device that you’re working on because you really get great fidelity. And with the open project format, you can go back and forth between Xcode and Playgrounds. So, as Bob said, we can really envision people using this for a lot of rapid prototyping on the go without having to bring along the rest of their development environment so we think it’s a really, really powerful addition to our development development tools this year.”</p><p> “如果你是开发人员，”添加Mariners-Mes，“它实际上更加富有成效，能够在您正在进行的设备上运行该应用程序，因为您真的得到了极大的保真度。使用开放式项目格式，您可以在Xcode和游乐场之间来回来回。所以，随着鲍勃说，我们可以真正设想人们在旅途中使用这一点，而无需带来其余的开发环境，所以我们认为这是我们今年开发开发工具的真正非常强大的补充。“</p><p> I can’t be the only developer wondering just how much of my apps I could shoehorn into Swift Playgrounds now that it can build apps, just so I can tweak them on the go 😅 Especially since it supports UIKit development, not just SwiftUI, and Swift packages  pic.twitter.com/vpsEMlVigs</p><p> 我不能成为唯一想知道我的应用程序，我现在可以建立一个应用程序，所以它可以构建应用程序，所以我可以在Go♪♪特别支持uikit开发，而不仅仅是Swifui，而且Swift包pic.twitter.com/vpsemlvigs.</p><p> Way back in 2018 I  profiled a new team at Apple that was building out a testing apparatus that would help them to make sure they were addressing real-world use cases for flows of process that included machines like the (at the time un-revealed) new Mac Pro, iMacs, MacBooks and iPads. One of the demos that stood out at the time was a deep integration with music apps like Logic that would allow the input models of iPad to complement the core app. Tapping out a rhythm on a pad, brightening or adjusting sound more intuitively with the touch interface. More of Apple’s work these days seems to be aimed at allowing users to move seamlessly back and forth between its various computing platforms, taking advantage of the strengths of each (raw power, portability, touch, etc) to complement a workflow. A lot of iPadOS 15 appears to be geared this way.</p><p> 回到2018年，我在苹果上阐述了一个新的团队，建立了一个测试装置，该苹果可以帮助他们确保他们正在寻求现实世界使用案例，以便包括（当时未透露）这样的机器的流程新的Mac Pro，imacs，MacBooks和iPads。当时突出的演示之一是与逻辑等音乐应用程序的深度集成，这将允许iPad的输入模型补充核心应用程序。用触摸界面敲击垫上的节奏，亮起或调整声音。这些日子的更多苹果的工作似乎旨在允许用户在其各种计算平台之间可以在各种计算平台之间来回移动，从而利用每个（原始电源，便携性，触摸等）的优势来补充工作流程。很多iPados 15似乎以这种方式造成齿轮。</p><p> Whether it will be enough to turn the corner on the perception of iPad as a work device that is being held back by software, I’ll reserve judgement until it ships later this year. But, in the near term, I am cautiously optimistic that this set of enhancements that break out of the ‘app box’, the clearer affordances for multitasking both in and out of single apps and the dedication to API support are pointing towards an expansionist mentality on the iPad software team. A good sign in general.</p><p> 是否足以让拐角处于iPad作为由软件重新阻止的工作设备的看法，我将在今年晚些时候填写判决。但是，在近期，我谨慎乐观，这组增强功能突破了“App Box”，在单个应用程序中脱离了“App Box”，为多任务处理的可供选择以及API支持的奉献指向扩展主义心态在iPad软件团队上。一般的一个好签到。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/apples-ipados-15-breaks-the-app-barrier/">https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/apples-ipados-15-breaks-the-app-barrier/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/应用/">#应用</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/app/">#app</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/应用程序/">#应用程序</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
