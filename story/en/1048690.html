In fact, I&#39;m learning something new. So much so, that I keep writing down my ideas and shuffling their implications. And suddenly, I realize something. In the past 15-minutes, I&#39;ve only managed to cover three pages and I&#39;m already thinking about next things I&#39;m supposed to do. Cleaning, picking-up the groceries, doing my excercises, writing a couple of lines of code, watching a movie...</p><p>这本书令人兴奋，故事有趣。实际上，我正在学习新知识。如此之多，以至于我不断写下我的想法并改写它们的含义。突然之间，我意识到了一些事情。在过去的15分钟内，我仅设法覆盖了三页，并且我已经在考虑接下来要做的事情。清洁，捡杂货，练习，写几行代码，看电影...</p><p>  So I stop and think. When was the last moment that took longer than 10 seconds, where I didn&#39;t have an urge to check an app on my phone, see if I got new email, or impulsively do something else?</p><p>  所以我停下来思考。什么时候是最后一个耗时超过10秒的时刻，我没有冲动检查手机上的应用，看是否收到新电子邮件或冲动地做其他事情？</p><p> By now, where I live, it&#39;s been many months of nightly curfews and limitations on travel and social life. I consider myself a very fortunate person to have suffered a relatively small impact from the global pandemic. Nonetheless, I can&#39;t stop but think about why my mind feels so exhausted while at the same time requiring a constant stream of stimulus that results in overbearing distraction.</p><p> 到现在为止，我住的地方已经有许多个月的宵禁，并且对旅行和社交生活有所限制。我认为自己是一个非常幸运的人，受到了全球大流行影响的影响相对较小。尽管如此，我不能停下来，想一想为什么我的头脑如此疲惫，同时又需要持续不断的刺激以至于导致过度分心。</p><p> It was already before the pandemic that I heard my colleagues talking about &#34;  digital detox&#34; and discussing their efforts to break out of being constantly connected while trying to regain their energy and allowing for some rest. Thus, I surely know that I&#39;m not alone with these thoughts.</p><p> 在大流行之前，我已经听到我的同事在谈论＆＃34;。数字排毒讨论他们为恢复精力并让自己有休息而努力摆脱不断联系的努力。因此，我当然知道我并不孤单。</p><p> Finally, after subscribing to  Audible last summer, there only remains little time in my day when I am not stimulating my brain in one way or another. It was some sort of a panic that hit me when I realized that I am no longer able to enjoy a thing that I&#39;ve always enjoyed so much, reading a great book at length.</p><p> 最终，在去年夏天订阅了Audible之后，当我没有以一种或另一种方式刺激我的大脑时，只有很少的时间在我的一天中。当我意识到我再也无法享受我一直以来都非常喜欢的东西了，又不停地阅读一本好书时，这让我感到非常恐慌。</p><p>  &#34;Yeah right! It&#39;s like we must constantly be multitasking or something... Even when I get to playing a Playstation game and it starts to load, I just all the time have to unlock my phone and check what is going on...&#34;</p><p>  ＆＃34;是的！就像我们必须不断地执行多任务处理之类的事情...即使我开始玩Playstation游戏并开始加载，我也总是需要解锁手机并检查发生了什么... ＆＃34;</p><p>  I recently read  a book where Naval describes what meditation means for him, and I cannot help but agree with his way of putting it.</p><p>  我最近读了一本书，其中海军描述了冥想对他意味着什么，我不禁同意他的冥想方式。 </p><p> One only needs to stop and observe his thoughts in a calm state. Your mind is like a monkey in a room, misbehaving and throwing feces all over the walls. It is fascinating how you realize this while trying to focus on your breath and not let your thoughts wander. In a matter of seconds, however, you already catch yourself thinking about entirely something different. When practicing to focus your attention and letting your thoughts pass, this inner monkey seems to eventually calm down and let you achieve a little peace of mind. It is not so easy.</p><p>一个人只需要停下来观察他的思想，保持镇定。您的头脑就像房间里的猴子，行为异常，并在墙壁上乱扔粪便。当您尝试着专注于自己的呼吸而不让您的思想徘徊时，您如何实现这一点令人着迷。然而，在短短的几秒钟内，您已经开始思考完全不同的东西。当练习集中注意力并让自己的想法通过时，这只内心的猴子似乎最终会平静下来，并让您获得一点内心的平静。这不是那么容易。</p><p>  After so many months of being limited with our social interactions, it feels like the scariest thing out there is to be left by ourselves. Especially us young people tend to handle this quite badly. Without typical distractions and mental stimulus available throughout our days, our mind starts to seek for something to occupy itself resulting in raised anxiety levels and stress. We are today forced to confront our inner selves like never before.</p><p>  在经历了这么多月的社交互动后，感觉就像是我们自己所剩下的最可怕的事情。尤其是我们年轻人往往很难做到这一点。在我们整天没有典型的分心和精神刺激的情况下，我们的思想开始寻找自己的东西来占据自己，从而导致焦虑水平和压力增加。今天，我们被迫以前所未有的方式面对内心的自我。</p><p>  Billions of dollars are invested and brightest specialists are hired each year to engineer new distractions. They fight for every second of our limited attention spans, leading us further astray without us even noticing it.</p><p>  每年投入数十亿美元，并聘请最聪明的专家来设计新的干扰项目。他们争夺我们有限注意力的每一秒，使我们进一步误入歧途，而我们甚至没有注意到。</p><p> When shortest breaks require distraction and only the rarest moments, such as taking a shower, offer a refuge from our electronic devices, how are we supposed to work towards our long-term goals? The type of goals that can only be achieved when managing to work in a state of sustained attention? Rarely do great things in life come in a form of neatly packaged gratification to which we are getting more and more accustomed to.</p><p> 如果最短暂的休息需要分心，而只有最罕见的时刻（例如洗澡）为我们的电子设备提供庇护，我们应该如何实现长期目标？只有在持续关注的情况下工作才能实现的目标类型？生活中很少有伟大的事情以整洁的满足感形式出现，我们越来越习惯了。</p><p> Reading reports and hearing on the radio that the general feeling and wellbeing in our societies during these challenging times is again on decline, constant distractions might truly be the enemy that stands in our way of what we ought to achieve.</p><p> 阅读报告并在广播中听到，在这个充满挑战的时期，我们社会的总体感觉和福祉再次下降，不断分散的注意力可能确实是阻碍我们应实现的目标的敌人。</p><p>  At some point I read that  South Koreans already pay to live in a hotel-like &#34;prison&#34; to relieve themselves from digital devices. I&#39;m not quite ready to go that far just yet.</p><p>  在某些时候，我读到韩国人已经为住在像旅馆一样的“监狱”中支付了费用。从数字设备中解脱出来。我还没有准备好走那么远。</p><p> Admittedly, a cottage in the middle of nowhere in Finland would be the way to go anyways.</p><p> 不可否认，无论如何，在芬兰茫茫荒野中的小屋是必经之路。 </p><p>  Once upon a time before the pandemic I saw a colleague of mine use his phone as we were picking up lunch, and I couldn&#39;t help but ask why was the screen black and white? He told me he does it intentionally to make his handset less attractive, resulting in less tapping around. That struck me as bizarre. How odd, do we really need to resort to such approaches?</p><p>大流行发生前的一段时间，我看到我的一个同事在我们吃午饭时使用他的电话，我不禁要问为什么屏幕是黑色和白色的？他告诉我，他是故意这样做的，以使其手机吸引力降低，从而减少拍打声。这让我感到奇怪。我们真的需要诉诸这种方法有多奇怪？</p><p>  Unlike South Koreans with their voluntary confinement, or my friend with his greyscale screen, I started with some less drastic measures. These small changes proved enormously helpful.</p><p>  与韩国人自愿禁闭或我的朋友使用灰度屏幕不同，我从一些不太严厉的措施入手。这些小变化被证明是非常有帮助的。</p><p> First of all, I opened the screen-time function on my phone and looked through apps that sent me most notifications, proceeding to drastically dial them back. Today, most phones have a feature to limit the screen-time of apps, locking you out after a certain amount of time has passed. This function is plain useless for me or my friends whom I&#39;ve seen to just enter their pin every single time they wanted to do something. What I did instead was that I just plain and simply uninstalled Instagram.</p><p> 首先，我打开了手机的屏幕时间功能，并查看了向我发送最多通知的应用程序，然后进行了大幅度的回拨。如今，大多数手机都具有限制应用程序屏幕显示时间的功能，可以在经过一定时间后将您锁定。对于我或我曾经见过的每一次想做某事的朋友来说，此功能就毫无用处。相反，我只是简单地卸载了Instagram。</p><p> I had contemplated to delete it for a long time and almost did it, but instead always settled to just disable the notifications. When I finally did this however, two interesting realizations struck me.</p><p> 我曾考虑删除它很长一段时间，并且几乎做到了，但是总会决定只禁用通知。但是，当我最终做到这一点时，有两个有趣的想法打动了我。</p><p> First thing was that during the initial couple of weeks without the app I was totally surprised at how little I missed it. It literally had never provided me with anything of value, and I only used it to post an occasional update. Why didn&#39;t I uninstall it earlier? There was no feeling of missing out. Wow, this realization echoed a feeling that I had after uninstalling 9GAG many years earlier.</p><p> 第一件事是在没有应用程序的最初几周内，我对自己错过的机会感到非常惊讶。从字面上看，它从来没有为我提供任何有价值的东西，而我只是用它来发布偶尔的更新。为什么我没有早些卸载它？没有错过的感觉。哇，这种认识回荡了我多年卸载9GAG之后的感觉。</p><p> Second, I didn&#39;t even notice how those colorful icons on the home-screen invited me to tap on their respective apps as soon as I found myself aimlessly scrolling through my phone. I understood this in a particularly strong way after hiding another app, LinkedIn. Being an important tool for my work, all I did in addition to hiding it from the homescreen was to disable the last types of notifications I ever received from them. Lo&#39; and behold, I now use this application significantly less and it makes a whole world of a difference.</p><p> 其次，当我发现自己漫无目的地滚动手机时，我什至没有注意到主屏幕上的那些彩色图标如何邀请我点击各自的应用程序。隐藏另一个应用程序LinkedIn之后，我以一种特别强烈的方式理解了这一点。作为我工作的重要工具，除了将其隐藏在主屏幕之外，我所做的就是禁用我从他们那里收到的最新通知。罗＆＃39;而且，我现在大大减少了使用该应用程序的时间，它改变了整个世界。</p><p> Simple, easy and fast. Your life will be better for it, just try! Exponential returns of joy are expected if you have apps like Tiktok, Clubhouse, Snapchat, or other such platforms installed or bookmarked, that you can easily subject to the same fate and never look back.</p><p> 简单，轻松，快速。尝试一下，您的生活会更好一些！如果您安装了Tiktok，Clubhouse，Snapchat或其他类似平台的应用程序或添加了书签，则可能会获得指数级的欢乐回报，您可以轻松承受同样的命运，而永不回头。 </p><p> So far, I&#39;m mostly talking about my precious free time. But what could be some simple and small things that I could do when I&#39;m working on my projects?</p><p>到目前为止，我主要是在谈论我宝贵的空闲时间。但是，当我在项目上工作时，我可能会做些简单的小事情吗？</p><p>  I&#39;ve written about doing  an experiment and turning myself into a productivity monster back in 2017, and I&#39;ve recently re-read the post and carefully re-implemented some of my learnings this year. But then again, it&#39;s not about going radical, but rather focusing on some small things that are easy to implement.</p><p>  我曾写过一篇关于做实验并将自己变成2017年生产力怪兽的文章，最近我重新阅读了这篇文章，并认真地重新实施了今年的一些学习成果。但话又说回来，这不是要激进，而是要着眼于一些易于实现的小事情。</p><p> Kill the unnecessary Slack and Teams notifications now! Adjust the surprisingly good defaults that Slack provides and make sure none of them, except for the most important notifications, hit your phone after your working hours are over.</p><p> 立即杀死不必要的Slack和Teams通知！调整Slack提供的令人惊讶的良好默认设置，并确保除了最重要的通知以外，没有其他设置会在您的工作时间结束后打您的电话。</p><p> Use effective time-blocking techniques like  Pomodoro for the less pleasant and repetitive, but still important tasks. This, like many other things, I&#39;ve also learned from one of my colleagues using it in an effective manner.</p><p> 对于不太愉快和重复但仍然很重要的任务，请使用有效的时间阻塞技术（例如Pomodoro）。就像许多其他事情一样，我也从我的一位同事那里学到了有效使用它的方法。</p><p> Oh, and of course make sure to consider the following crazy important golden rule of life and the universe:  don&#39;t do anything else while having a one-on-one interaction with someone. Just never do this.</p><p> 哦，当然，请务必考虑以下关于生命和宇宙的疯狂的重要黄金法则：在与某人进行一对一互动时，请勿做任何其他事情。只是永远不要这样做。</p><p> I catch myself with this one sometimes and no matter how small of a signal, it can still tell something to my counterpart. Such mistakes during limited and valuable interactions in these pandemic-ridden times can eat away from our important professional relationships. When having conversations, focus on them fully and wholeheartedly. Multitask when the time is right.</p><p> 我有时会遇到这个问题，无论信号有多小，它仍然可以告诉我的对方。在这些大流行的时代中，有限而有价值的互动中的此类错误可能会吞噬我们重要的专业关系。进行对话时，请全神贯注地专注于对话。时间合适时执行多任务。</p><p> Oh, and try drinking less coffee in the mornings while cutting alcohol in the evenings, but you&#39;ve heard this a million times before. Additionally, to all of you who have small kids at home, I truly salute your efforts and patience getting through with this!</p><p> 哦，尝试在早晨少喝咖啡，在晚上减少饮酒，但您在一百万次之前就已经听说过。此外，对于所有在家带小孩的人，我真的向您表示敬意，并为此付出了耐心！ </p><p>  What if the most sought after and desired skill of the future will be the ability to best manage our constant distractions and maintain a sustained state of productive focus?</p><p>如果将来最受追捧和期望的技能将是能够最好地管理我们不断分散的注意力并保持生产重点的持续状态的能力呢？</p><p> If we can&#39;t manage to control our whims, we won&#39;t be able to work effectively towards our long-term goals. I guess it&#39;s just that simple.</p><p> 如果我们无法控制自己的想法，我们将无法有效地实现我们的长期目标。我想就这么简单。</p><p>  Reflection and brutal honesty with oneself while trying to understand what is happening is critical before driving corrections and adjustments into one&#39;s behavior. As our society adjusts to challenges posed by global pandemics, there is a chance for us to walk out of this stronger than before. This is a chance for us to learn more about ourselves than would&#39;ve otherwise been possible, right?</p><p>  在试图纠正和调整自己的行为之前，试图理解正在发生的事情的自我反思和残酷诚实至关重要。随着我们的社会适应全球流行病带来的挑战，我们有机会摆脱以往的这种强大势头。这是我们有机会比其他方式更多地了解自己的知识，对吧？</p><p>     If you enjoyed this post, consider subscribing for an occasional update.
