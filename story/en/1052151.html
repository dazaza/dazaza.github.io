Rozman, an international chess master, scrolled through the profile, disbelieving. His opponent had climbed nearly a thousand points in the span of a month, ranking 2,300 to Rozman’s 2,431. And his profile didn’t include the sort of title—“FIDE master,” “national master”—that the ranking implied. In fact, Rozman would later discover, Dewa_Kipas, or “fan god,” was a bird-feed seller in Indonesia.</p><p>3月2日，在粉红色毛衣和圆眼镜中征收Rozman正在将他的Chess.com与抽搐相匹配到12,000名观众。 “好吧，这看起来像一个骗子，”他说没有暂停，因为他点击了他对手的鸽子迪沃·普斯的鸽子图标。 Rozman是一个国际国际象棋大师，通过个人资料滚动，不相信。他的对手在一个月的跨度攀登了近一千个点，排名在2,300到罗兹曼的2,431。他的个人资料没有包括这类标题 - “fide master，”国家大师“ - 暗示的排名。事实上，Rozman稍后会发现，Dewa_kipas或“粉丝上帝”，是印度尼西亚的鸟类饲养员。</p><p> Chat echoed back: “LMAOOOO,” “CHEATER.” “Let’s see if we can get some content here,” said Rozman.</p><p> 聊天回声：“lmaoooo，”骗子。“ “让我们看看我们是否可以在这里获得一些内容，”Rozman说。</p><p> Rozman has been playing in chess tournaments since he was seven. In 2011, he attained National Master status, and in 2018, International Master. Now 25, he’s known not only on the chess circuit; like other top players, he has developed a large following on Twitch, on YouTube, and on Twitter. High-level chess has experienced an  unprecedented online boom due to the pandemic. An average of 895 people watched chess streamers on Twitch on March 1, 2020; a year later that cumulative audience expanded to 21,491.</p><p> 自从他七年以来，Rozman一直在棋比赛。 2011年，他达到了国家硕士地位，2018年国际大师。现在25，他不仅仅是棋盘电路;像其他顶级球员一样，他在抽搐，在YouTube和Twitter上开发了一个大的追随者。由于大流行，高级国际象棋遭遇了前所未有的在线热潮。平均895人在2020年3月1日在抽搐上观看了国际象棋飘带;一年后，累计观众扩大到21,491。</p><p>  In this majority-digital world for the 1,500-year-old game, it’s tempting to trust that every truly high-level player would by now be a known quantity—whether through International Chess Federation ratings or social media. Nobody could just come out of nowhere and dethrone a chess king, right?</p><p>  在这款多数人的数字世界中，为1,500岁的比赛，相信每一个真正的高级球员现在都会是一个已知的数量 - 无论是通过国际国际象棋联合会的评级或社交媒体。没有人可以脱离无处和挑剔的象棋王，对吗？</p><p> Rozman knew that if his opponent was cheating it would be a strange game; algorithms often make choices that most humans simply wouldn’t. Still, small things baffled him. At Rozman’s level, obvious moves typically play out in a couple of seconds. Dewa_Kipas regularly took between seven and 10 seconds to make any move against the chess master, even when he had just one or two options. Highlighting Dewa_Kipas’s knight on his stream, Rozman said he was worried that his opponent might move it to A5. “I would expect this, although it is a computer, so I also kind of expect some weird pawn play,” he said. The knight moved to A5.</p><p> Rozman知道，如果他的对手在欺骗这将是一个奇怪的比赛;算法通常会做出大多数人根本不会的选择。仍然，小事让他感到困惑。在Rozman的水平，明显的动作通常在几秒钟内发挥出来。 Dewa_kipas定期在七到10秒之间达到棋主，即使他只有一个或两个选择。 Rozman表示，突出Dewa_kipas的骑士在他的溪流上，他担心他的对手可能将它移动到A5。 “我会期待这一点，虽然是一台电脑，所以我也有点期待一些奇怪的典当游戏，”他说。骑士搬到了A5。</p><p>  In their attempts to climb the competitive ladder, cheaters refer to AI-powered chess engines to inform their moves. And as chess has moved more and more online, cheating allegations have skyrocketed, according to top online chess site Chess.com. Rozman has himself turned cheat-hunting into a bit. On YouTube, where his thumbnails are full of silly faces and chess boards, Rozman ran a “catching cheaters” series, which he spun into a similarly themed Discord channel. It’s an entertaining break from the big-brain chess plays and long, thinky matches—lighthearted morsels in the rapidly ballooning content economy of online chess.</p><p>  在他们试图爬上竞争力的阶梯，骗子指的是AI动力国际象棋发动机，以通知他们的举措。随着国际象棋越来越多的在线，欺诈指控已经飙升，根据顶级在线国际象棋网站Chess.com。 Rozman让他自己转过身来欺骗。在YouTube上，他的缩略图充满了愚蠢的面孔和棋盘，Rozman跑了一个“捕捉骗子”系列，他旋转到类似主题的不和谐频道。这是从大型大脑棋手的娱乐休息，渴望思考的竞争匹配 - 在线象棋的快速膨胀内容经济中的速度偏差。</p><p>  Twelve thousand viewers cheered Rozman on as he played against Dewa_Kipas. About 10 minutes in, his opponent’s rook had blocked in Rozman’s king. Black won. “REPORT HIM!” “POLICE!” yelled chat.</p><p>  当他对阵Dewa_kipas的时候，十二千名观众欢呼Rozman。大约10分钟，他的对手的车在罗兹曼的国王中封锁了。黑人赢了。 “报告他！” “警察！”聊天聊天。 </p><p>  Rozman again perused his opponent’s stats. Dewa_Kipas’ accuracy, or similarity to how a chess engine would play, during the match was 94 percent; Rozman’s was 76. Over its last 10 games, the account’s accuracy never dipped below 80. It hit over over 99 percent in two of those. Rozman reported him that day. Hours later, Chess.com banned the account.</p><p>Rozman再次仔细阅读了他的对手的统计数据。在比赛期间，Dewa_kipas的准确性，或者如何与国际象棋引擎如何发挥作用，为94％; Rozman's是76岁。在过去的10场比赛中，账户的准确性从未浸到过以下80岁以下。其中两个人超过99％。 Rozman那天报道了他。小时之后，Chess.com禁止了帐户。</p><p> That night hateful messages, many written in Indonesian, began to fill Rozman’s social feeds. Threats, even. His girlfriend received the same: “hey bitch, we will kill u soon haha, from indonesia :).” Rozman was getting tagged on Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, with accusations that he had leveraged his notoriety to ban a legitimate player. What sparked the onslaught, he would learn, was a post on an anime superfan’s Facebook page.</p><p> 那个夜晚的仇恨消息，许多在印度尼西亚写的许多消息开始填补Rozman的社交饲料。威胁，甚至。他的女朋友收到了同样的话：“嘿婊子，我们会很快杀死你，来自印度尼西亚:)。” Rozman在Twitter上被标记，Youtube，Instagram，指责他已经利用他的臭名昭着禁止合法球员。他将学习的是爆发的，是一个在一个动漫超级班的Facebook页面上的帖子。</p><p>  Ali Akbar, a 24-year-old whose Facebook banner is a sprawl of pink-haired shoujo manga, had written a post about Rozman from his home in Bandung, Indonesia, to his 3,500 followers. According to Akbar, Dewa_Kipas was a 60-year-old retired tournament player named Dadang Subur who had only recently become addicted to Chess.com. Also, he wrote, Subur was his dad. And he most certainly did beat chess master Rozman.</p><p>  Ali Akbar，一个24岁的Facebook Banner是粉红色的Shoujo Manga蔓延，写了一篇关于Rozman的帖子，他在印度尼西亚万隆的家中，他的3,500名粉丝。据Akbar称，Dewa_kipas是一名名为Dadang Subur的60岁的退休锦标赛球员，最近沉迷于Chess.com。另外，他写道，苏尔是他的爸爸。他当然最终击败了国际象棋大师罗兹曼。</p><p> In terse bullet points above an endless scroll of anime memes, Akbar told a much different version of the match: how his father had played a famous Twitch streamer, won, and was then mass-reported by Rozman’s huge fan base. “My father&#39;s account was blocked,” he wrote in Indonesian. “I swear I don&#39;t accept it ... because public figures can block people&#39;s accounts at will.”</p><p> 在简洁的小组点以上A动漫模因的无尽卷轴上，Akbar告诉了一场不同的匹配版本：他的父亲如何发挥着着名的抽搐拖把，然后由Rozman的巨大粉丝群群众报道。 “我的父亲＆＃39; S帐户被封锁，”他在印度尼西亚写道。 “我发誓，我不接受它......因为公众人物可以阻止人们＆＃39;愿意。”</p><p> “We’re acting with no emotion and no investment other than to protect the integrity of the game.”</p><p> “我们没有任何情绪，除了保护游戏的完整性之外，没有其他投资。”</p><p> Akbar’s post went viral. His allegation—that the word of a celebrity chess master is weighed more heavily than an average player’s— resonated with thousands of people, including both lesser-known chess enthusiasts and very online Indonesians fed up with Western internet celebrity culture. Memes flooded Rozman’s private inboxes, some demanding a rematch. A post accusing Rozman’s fans of mass-reporting Subur, a “retired professional chess player,” rocketed to the top of the Chess subreddit with thousands of upvotes. (The thread was locked, moderators wrote underneath, because it was being “heavily brigaded by outside groups” and “unsubstantiated.”) Indonesian news media  covered  the  controversy too, painting Rozman as an entitled celebrity. Rozman was receiving several messages, comments, and tweets every minute in Indonesian.</p><p> Akbar的帖子去了病毒。他的指控 - 即名人棋大师的话比平均参与者融为一筹，包括成千上万的人，包括较鲜为人知的国际象棋爱好者和融合西方互联网名人文化的英美印度尼西亚人。 MEMES被淹没的Rozman的私人收件箱，一些要求一名rematch。指责Rozman的批量报告副舞台的职位，一个“退休的专业国际象棋球员”，飙升到国际象棋潜水员的顶部，凭借成千上万的回升。 （该线程被锁定，主持人在下面写道，因为它是“由外部群体大量抢劫”和“未经证实的。”）印度尼西亚新闻媒体也涵盖了争议，绘制Rozman作为题为名人。 Rozman在印度尼西亚每分钟收到几条消息，评论和推文。</p><p> Rozman tried to explain on Twitter that Chess.com wouldn’t ban somebody just because he or his fans had reported them, that there was a whole process involved to weed out alleged cheaters, but it was no use. He locked down his accounts.</p><p> Rozman试图在Twitter上解释Chess.com不会因为他或他的粉丝报告他们而不是因为他或他的粉丝报告而言，那里有一个整个过程涉及杂草所谓的骗子，但它没有用。他锁定了他的账户。 </p><p> Sign up for the latest gaming tips, reviews, and features, in your inbox every week.</p><p>注册您每周收件箱中的最新游戏提示，评论和功能。</p><p> “I didn’t know if I should double down, or just apologize to reel it in,” says Rozman. “I knew I was in the right, but sometimes, you just take the L. It’s an insane situation.”</p><p> “我不知道我是否应该加倍，或者只是为了卷剑而道歉，”Rozman说。 “我知道我在右边，但有时候，你只是拿到L.这是一个疯狂的情况。”</p><p>  At 7 am Eastern time on March 3, Rozman messaged Akbar to reconcile. “Hope we can discuss things peacefully,” he wrote. Akbar said he was sorry that his post sparked harassment, and offered to explain all of the abnormalities with his father’s account. He listed out the most common questions, and then supplied answers: Why had Subur only played Blitz, or fast chess, a couple of times, when most 2,300-level players have high scores in that discipline as well as Chess Puzzles? (He can’t move that quickly, especially on his old Android.) Why was his rank in Puzzle so bad? (Akbar himself had played it, on his father’s account, “on a whim.”) Why did he only play Rapid chess, in which matches have a 60-minute limit? (He is technologically challenged, and it’s the only traditional chess mode he can access from the app’s main menu without changing settings.) Why did his ranking increase so dramatically? (He played nonstop for hours.) Why were his moves so similar to a bot’s? (Because he trained against bots.) Akbar recorded a 20-minute video with his father in which Subur claims he beat Shredder, a commercial chess engine, on a grandmaster-level setting four times in a row. They buckled down.</p><p>  在3月3日的东部时间为7，Rozman Messaged Akbar协调。 “希望我们能和平讨论事情，”他写道。 Akbar说他很遗憾他的帖子引发了骚扰，并提出与父亲的账户解释所有异常。他列出了最常见的问题，然后提供了答案：为什么苏尔只播放闪电战或快速棋子，几次，当大多数2300级球员在该学科以及国际象棋难题中有高分的比分？ （他不能快速移动，特别是在他的旧的Android上。）为什么他的拼图等级如此糟糕？ （Akbar自己曾在父亲的账户上播放了它，“在一定之处。”）为什么他只是玩快速的国际象棋，其中比赛有60分钟的限制？ （他在技术上挑战，它是他可以在没有更改的情况下从应用程序的主菜单访问的唯一传统的国际象棋模式。）为什么他的排名急剧增加？ （他播放了不间断的时间。）为什么他的动作如此类似的机器人？ （因为他接受了对抗机器人训练。他们扣上了。</p><p> Through his son, Subur agreed to an audio interview with WIRED over WhatsApp, later translated from Indonesian to English. Subur says that he started playing chess in junior high. He was self-taught and owns a lot of chess books. He joined several local chess clubs, attended local tournaments, and even trained under his neighbor, the late chess grandmaster Herman Suradiradja. (WIRED could not confirm this.) He likes the Caro-Kann Defense, the Sicilian Defense, and Gambit. He began to play against Shredder, he says, when he got an iPhone 3GS. He believes character and memorization are key to high-level chess play, but tempo, or pressuring your opponents in an optimal number of moves, is the most important. “I mastered the tempo, and when you master the tempo, it doesn’t matter who your opponent is.”</p><p> 通过他的儿子，苏尔同意与Whatsapp的有线进行的音频访谈，后来从印度尼西亚语翻译为英语。苏尔说，他开始在初中下棋。他是自我教导的，拥有很多国际象棋书籍。他加入了几个当地的国际象棋俱乐部，参加了当地锦标赛，甚至在他的邻居培训，这是北象棋宏伟的赫尔曼·塞拉德拉德哈。 （有线无法确认这一点。）他喜欢Caro-Kann Defense，Sicilian Defense和Gambit。他说，当他有iPhone 3GS时，他开始对阵碎片。他相信性格和记忆是高级国际象棋戏剧的关键，但节奏，或在最佳的动作中向对手施加压力，是最重要的。 “我掌握了节奏，当你掌握节奏时，你的对手是谁的。”</p><p>  Subur maintains that the game was legitimate. But he condemns the harassment, saying those responsible for it “don’t understand the situation.”</p><p>  苏尔认为游戏是合法的。但他谴责骚扰，说那些对它的人“不明白这种情况”。</p><p> “He is a kind man,” he says of Rozman. “I don’t feel better than him. The play was in my favor at the time. That is all.”</p><p> “他是一个善良的人，”他说罗兹曼说。 “我感觉不比他好。当时这场比赛是我的青睐。就这些。”</p><p> His son, Akbar, shared a Google Drive with WIRED containing a 2005 chess certificate congratulating Subur on first place at the Singkawang City Chess Championship, a photograph of his father holding up a “Jasindo Chess Tournament 2012” banner with several other men, and several videos of a hand flipping through a book of hand-written chess notations from games against Shredder. He also included a message for Chess.com, stating his father has no FIDE rating because he was, before he retired five years ago, just an office worker who was passionate about chess.</p><p> 他的儿子Akbar，分享了一个谷歌驱动器，其中包含了一个有线的谷歌驱动器，其中包含了2005年国际象棋证明祝贺苏尔队在Singkawang City国际象棋锦标赛中，他的父亲举起“Jasindo国际象棋2012年2012年”横幅与其他几名男子，以及几个翻转通过手写的棋子的书的手的录影从游戏反对碎纸机。他还包括Chess.com的一条消息，陈述他的父亲没有FIDE评级，因为他在五年前退休之前，只是一个关于国际象棋的办公室工作者。 </p><p> “We operate in the realm of statistics,” says Danny Rensch, Chess.com’s COO. “And in statistics, there is never certainty-certainty. There’s always the realm of anomalies.” It’s always possible, for example, that someone could play the best chess game of their life while they’re drunk off their ass. It’s just so very unlikely.</p><p>“我们在统计领域运作，”Chess.com的Coo说，Danny Rensch说。 “在统计数据中，从未确定过确定。总有异常的领域。“例如，它总是可能的，有人可以在他们喝完屁股时扮演他们生活中最好的国际象棋游戏。它非常不可能。</p><p> The controversy was already in motion when Rensch entered the fray—“one of the most crazy” controversies online chess had ever seen. “It hasn’t gone away.”</p><p> 当君氏进入磨损时，争议已经举动 - “最疯狂的”争论曾经见过的争议之一。 “它没有消失。”</p><p> An international chess master himself, Rensch wanted to see Chess.com’s report on Dewa_Kipas so he could assess the site’s decision to ban him. Chess.com has its own seven-person Fair Play team, less like moderators and more like data scientists, which Rensch oversees. The case of Dewa_Kipas got a lot of eyes at Chess.com, in part because of the brigading Rozman experienced after his very public, very confident report. The site hears about alleged cheaters both from player reports and alerts from algorithms, which the Fair Play team uses to help make banning decisions. Internally, they’re called “cheat detectives.” They close thousands of Chess.com accounts every day.</p><p> 一个国际国际象棋大师本人，君氏想看Chess.com关于Dewa_kipas的报告，所以他可以评估该网站的决定禁止他。 Chess.com拥有自己的七个人公平播放团队，更不像主持人，更像是数据科学家，rensch监督。 Dewa_kipas的案例在Chess.com上有很多眼睛，部分是因为他公众非常自信的报告后经验丰富的罗兹曼。该网站聆听涉嫌欺骗者来自算法的报告和警报，公平扮演团队用来帮助禁止决定。在内部，他们被称为“作弊侦探”。他们每天都关闭了数千个国际象棋。</p><p>  Chess.com’s great challenge is determining what cheating in chess looks like over the internet: Is it a second monitor with a chess AI running? Is it a Discord chat with a grandmaster? Is it a straight-up bot?</p><p>  Chess.com的巨大挑战是确定国际象棋的作弊看起来像互联网：它是第二次显示国际象棋AI的监视器吗？这是一个不和谐聊天吗？它是直接机器人吗？</p><p> The site’s cheat-catching algorithm measures how closely a player’s moves resemble a chess engine’s. As there are a lot of those to choose from, Chess.com pools several together on top of Stockfish, an open source chess engine. What happens next is like the International Olympic Committee’s anti-doping measures, says Rensch. They know what the best athletes are capable of when their white blood cell count and oxygen levels are both normal and elevated. If something strays outside of that lane, he says, it looks like guilt. Winning streaks, other in-browser behavior like excessive tabbing, and whether they’re a FIDE-recognized or title player are all factors that the algorithm and moderators weigh.</p><p> 该网站的欺诈捕捉算法测量玩家的动作与国际象棋引擎的动作有多紧密。因为有很多可供选择的人，Chess.com池在一起在鳕鱼顶部，一个开源国际象棋引擎。 Rensch说，接下来的情况下接下来就像国际奥林匹克委员会的反兴奋剂措施一样。他们知道最好的运动员能够在它们的白细胞计数和氧水平均正常和升高时。如果在那条车道外面的东西，他说，它看起来像有罪。赢得条纹，其他浏览器行为，如过多的标签，以及它们是否是算法和主持人的重量的所有因素。</p><p> “We operate in the context of knowing who a lot of the best players in the world are already,” says Rensch. Rensch points to Alireza Firouzja, an Iranian kid who attained grandmaster status at age 14. “This kid grew up on my site,” he says. “I’ve been watching him play like a monster since he was 11.” Rensch would not say how many people have accused Firouzja of cheating. It’s a lot, though.</p><p> “我们在知道世界上有很多最佳球员的背景下的背景下运作了，”润恩斯说。 Rensch积分到Alireza Firouzja，这是一个达到14岁的兰德马斯特地位的伊朗人。“这个孩子在我的网站上长大，”他说。 “自从11起，我一直在看着他像怪物一样玩耍。”君恩不会说有多少人指责Firouzja作弊。但是，这很多。</p><p> Like many online platforms, lesser-known users often accuse Chess.com of protecting its stars. Onlookers scrutinizing Rozman’s stream drew a direct line between his report and Chess.com’s ban. Privilege. But Rensch says nothing could be further from the truth. They’ve even  banned chess masters over statistical anomalies. “We are legally ready to go to court with every closure we make. And we act on data and evidence,” he says. “Did [Rozman] actually have influence over any of the final decisions? Zero.”</p><p> 与许多在线平台一样，较少的用户经常指责Chess.com保护其星星。旁观者仔细检查Rozman的溪流在他的报告和Chess.com的禁令之间直接界限。特权。但君恩斯说什么都不能从真理中进一步。他们甚至禁止过统计异常的国际象棋大师。 “我们在合法准备和我们所做的每一个结束都要去法庭。我们说的是数据和证据，“他说。 “[Rozman]实际上对任何最终决定产生了影响吗？零。” </p><p>  Rensch says Dewa_Kipas was an “absolute, absolute certain case” of cheating. Over dozens of games, Chess.com determined that Dewa_Kipas’ moves in chess games matched a chess engine at a rate that is “not reasonably possible for a human player,” higher even than the top-ranked Indonesian chess player, grandmaster Susanto Megaranto: 95.3 to 94.4.</p><p>rensch说dewa_kipas是一种“绝对的绝对某些案例”的作弊。 Chess.com的几十个游戏，确定Dewa_kipas在国际象棋游戏中移动，以象棋引擎达到“人类播放器不合理”的速度，甚至比排名第一的印度尼西亚棋手，Grandmaster Susanto Megaranto： 95.3至94.4。</p><p> Rensch always tries to remind top players that they’re human. They’re emotional. They’re competitors. The most neutral actor here is the algorithm. There’s a famous saying by Emanuel Lasker, the longest-running World Chess Champion in history: “On the chessboard, lies and hypocrisy do not survive long.” And the algorithm, while not perfect, cuts down on that survival rate. “We’re acting with no emotion and no investment other than to protect the integrity of the game,” Rensch says.</p><p> 君恩总是试图提醒他们是人类的顶级球员。他们是情绪化的。他们是竞争对手。这里最中性的演员是算法。在历史上最长的世界国际象棋冠军举行的埃马尔·卢克尔有一个着名的谚语：“在棋盘上，谎言和虚伪不会生存。”和算法，虽然不完美，但削减了这种生存率。 “我们没有任何情绪，除了保护游戏的完整性之外，没有任何投资，”罗斯表示。</p><p> For Rozman, the nasty YouTube comments are down from 10 every minute to one every few minutes. More supportive messages in Indonesian have appeared in his Twitter mentions, some expressing shame for the brigading and harassment.
