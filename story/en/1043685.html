There are still little bits and pieces of untranslated menu text, but all of the main and important text has been run through Google Translate.</p><p>“ Funky Fantasy IV”是日本超级Famicom最终幻想IV的100％机器翻译版本。仍然有一些未翻译的菜单文本，但是所有主要和重要的文本都已通过Google翻译运行。</p><p> What’s especially interesting is that I did this project just as Google was updating its translation system to use advanced neural network A.I. So, by sheer luck, I wound up with two different translations: one before the switch and one after. The differences were so astounding and the online response was so great that I decided to   write an entire book about the project!</p><p> 尤其有趣的是，我在Google更新其翻译系统以使用高级神经网络AI的时候就做了这个项目。因此，很幸运，我总结了两种不同的翻译：一种在转换之前，另一种在转换之后。差异是如此惊人，在线响应是如此之好，以至于我决定写一本关于该项目的整本书！</p><p>   You can download both translation patches  here. Be sure to read the included text file first. And, most importantly:  Translation Patch #2 is the one you want to play!</p><p>   您可以在此处下载两个翻译补丁。确保先阅读随附的文本文件。而且，最重要的是：翻译补丁＃2是您要玩的补丁！</p><p> In 2020, about 4 years after my first Google Translation patches, I learned that a more sophisticated machine translation engine called DeepL added Japanese support. I used it to make a brand-new patch – see more details  here.</p><p> 在我的第一个Google翻译补丁发布约4年后的2020年，我了解到名为DeepL的更复杂的机器翻译引擎增加了日语支持。我用它制作了一个全新的补丁–在此处查看更多详细信息。</p><p>    I wrote some custom software to extract all of the text data from the Japanese game. I ran this program, then took the resulting text and ran it through a machine translation tool – in this case, Google Translate. My software then took the translated text, did a lot of reformatting and technical magic, and plopped the English text back into the Japanese game. The translated text was almost always too big to fit into the original game, so I also wrote some custom Super NES programming code to get all of the new text working.</p><p>    我写了一些自定义软件来提取日语游戏中的所有文本数据。我运行了该程序，然后获取了结果文本，并通过机器翻译工具（在本例中为Google Translate）运行了该文本。然后，我的软件接受了翻译后的文本，进行了许多重新格式化和技术魔术，并将英语文本放回日语游戏中。翻译后的文本几乎总是太大而无法容纳原始游戏，因此我还编写了一些自定义的Super NES编程代码，以使所有新文本都能正常工作。</p><p>  A common question I get is “Why even do this?” The quick summary is that this is just one small, experimental piece of a larger concept I’ve had for years. It also serves as the basis for a lot of things I’ve been wanting to try out for years. Here are some of those things:</p><p>  我收到的一个常见问题是“为什么还要这样做？”快速总结是，这只是我多年以来对较大概念的一个小实验性部分。它也是我多年来一直想尝试的很多事情的基础。以下是其中一些内容：</p><p>  I’ve spent the last few years  analyzing  Final Fantasy IV’s many different official localizations, and even the fan-translated version. While doing this, there’s always a question in the back of my mind: “What if a machine translated the game? How would that compare to each of these versions too?” I’m particularly interested in this question because machine translation has supposedly improved a lot since the last time I played around with it over a decade ago – people even have fancy machine translation apps on their phones these days for translating signs and trying to hold basic conversations.</p><p>  在过去的几年中，我分析了《最终幻想IV》的许多不同官方本地化版本，甚至是粉丝翻译版本。在执行此操作时，我脑子里总会问一个问题：“如果机器翻译了游戏会怎样？与这些版本的每个版本相比又如何呢？”我对这个问题特别感兴趣，因为自从我10年前上一次玩机器翻译以来，机器翻译据说有了很大的进步-如今，人们甚至在手机上都使用了精美的机器翻译应用程序来翻译标志和尝试掌握基本信息。对话。 </p><p>  I’ve spent years researching and writing about how games have been translated, but one thing I’ve never taken a look at is machine translation. It’s something I’d like to learn more about, and this is an interesting way to examine it. I’m already learning a lot of new things, and some of my expectations going in have been shattered. This is also an opportunity for me to see how far off people in my field are from getting replaced by computers 😛</p><p>我花了很多年研究和撰写游戏的翻译方式，但是我从未看过的一件事是机器翻译。这是我想了解的更多信息，这是一种有趣的检查方法。我已经学到了很多新东西，而对我的一些期望已经破灭了。这也是我看到自己的领域与被计算机取代有多远的机会😛</p><p>  Getting all of this up and working from scratch tapped into all of my interests, so this is also a fun little side project. It’s not as easy as taking translated text and pasting it into a new text file – I’ve had to learn a lot about the Super NES’ architecture, how to program for 65c816 processors, how to programmatically condense text to fit into text windows of limited size, and how to parse/recalculate text formatting when jumping between languages. It’s also been a lot of fun seeing the results.</p><p>  充分利用所有这些知识并从头开始工作，这是我的全部兴趣，因此，这也是一个有趣的小项目。这并不像将翻译后的文本粘贴到新的文本文件中那么容易–我不得不学习很多有关Super NES的体系结构，如何为65c816处理器编程，如何以编程方式压缩文本以适合以下语言的文本窗口的知识：大小限制，以及在不同语言之间跳转时如何解析/重新计算文本格式。看到结果也很有趣。</p><p>  I write about game translations and localizations a lot, but it’s often difficult to convey the different styles and approaches that translations/localizations can take. So for years I’ve thought about taking a single game, making a translation tool for it, and then using that setup to create translations and localizations that clearly showcase these different styles. These could then be compared side-by-side as whole games. It’s also a good testbed for experimentation.</p><p>  我写了很多关于游戏翻译和本地化的文章，但是通常很难传达翻译/本地化可以采用的不同风格和方法。因此，多年来，我一直在考虑制作一款游戏，为其制作翻译工具，然后使用该设置来创建可清楚展示这些不同风格的翻译和本地化版本。然后可以将它们作为整个游戏并排比较。这也是一个很好的实验平台。</p><p> For example, this tool could be used to demonstrate what a hyper-literal translation looks like vs. a hyper-liberal localization. It could be used to demonstrate how game localization changes and adapts depending on the environment too – what would the same game localization look like if you were forced to use fewer resources, such as memory? How might the same game be localized if it were handled by a large team vs. a small team? Or if it were handled in a crowdsourced environment? Or how much could you trim each sentence down and still keep the game’s story understandable/enjoyable? And, of course, what would it look like if a machine translated it?</p><p> 例如，此工具可用于演示超文字翻译与超自由本地化的外观。它可以用来演示游戏本地化如何根据环境而变化和适应-如果您被迫使用更少的资源（例如内存），那么同一游戏本地化会是什么样？如果同一游戏由大团队对小团队进行处理，该如何定位？还是在众包环境中处理？还是您可以将每个句子的内容删减多少，并保持游戏故事的可理解性/趣味性？而且，当然，如果机器翻译了它会是什么样？</p><p> With all this in mind, I thought it’d be nice to use  Final Fantasy IV as the game in question. There’s a lot of text involved, there’s a constantly moving plot, there are dozens of characters, it’s an iconic game, it’s already had many different localizations to compare to, and it’s relatively easy to dig into and reprogram. Plus I’m just a big fan of the game.</p><p> 考虑到所有这些，我认为将《最终幻想IV》用作相关游戏会很好。其中涉及大量文本，有一个不断变化的情节，有数十个字符，这是一个标志性的游戏，已经有许多不同的本地化要比较，并且相对容易进行挖掘和重新编程。另外，我只是游戏的忠实粉丝。</p><p> Basically, I’ve always wanted to tinker around with a game and try to localize it in different styles, to clearly show the many different approaches and philosophies, and what each of them end up looking like when put into practice. I think that’s why I like to call this all an “experiment”.</p><p> 基本上，我一直想尝试一下游戏，并尝试以不同的风格进行本地化，以清楚地展示出许多不同的方法和理念，以及每种方法最终付诸实践的样子。我认为这就是为什么我喜欢将其称为“实验”。</p><p>  There’s a lot more to be learned from a machine-translated project like this, too. For example,  Final Fantasy IV’s Super Famicom script is written entirely in Japanese katakana and hiragana. This was normal for the era, but games that only use these two writing systems are actually harder to read and understand unless you’re really good with the language already and can read between the lines. Later releases of the game switched to using katakana, hiragana, and the much more complicated kanji writing system. Even though kanji is tough to learn, it fills in those holes of context.</p><p>  从这样的机器翻译项目中也可以学到很多东西。例如，Final Fantasy IV的Super Famicom脚本完全用日语的片假名和平假名编写。在那个时代这是正常的，但是仅使用这两种书写系统的游戏实际上很难阅读和理解，除非您已经非常熟悉该语言并且可以在两行之间阅读。后来的游戏版本改用片假名，平假名和更为复杂的汉字书写系统。尽管汉字很难学习，但它填补了上下文中的这些空白。 </p><p>  Knowing this, I ran the Super Famicom game’s introduction through Google Translate, and then I ran the same text – but with the kanji included this time – through Google Translate. I then showed the two results side-by-side on stream for others to see live. As I expected, the kanji script was translated much more logically most of the time. I used this as a good example of why students of Japanese shouldn’t shy away from learning kanji, and why context is always at the core of the Japanese language.</p><p>知道了这一点后，我通过Google Translate运行了Super Famicom游戏的介绍，然后通过Google Translate运行了相同的文本，但这次包含了汉字。然后，我并行显示了两个结果，供其他人观看。如我所料，大多数时候汉字脚本的翻译更加合理。我以此为一个很好的例子，说明了为什么日语学生不应该回避学习汉字，以及为什么上下文始终是日语的核心。</p><p> Of course, this is also a good demonstration of what to expect from machine translations, and when they perform better in some situations than in others. For example, Japanese-to-English machine translations are generally better at handling small bits of text and short sentences with proper grammar. Anything beyond that, and all bets are off, especially given that “entertainment Japanese” is very different from normal, everyday Japanese.</p><p> 当然，这也很好地说明了机器翻译的期望，以及它们在某些情况下的性能要好于其他情况。例如，日语到英语的机器翻译通常更适合于以适当的语法处理少量的文本和简短的句子。除此之外，一切都没有了，特别是考虑到“娱乐日语”与普通的日常日语有很大不同。</p><p> I’ve also learned during the course of this project that online translation tools like Google Translate can drastically change from day to day. This came as a surprise to me, and is probably worth noting to anyone who relies on machine translations.</p><p> 在该项目的过程中，我还了解到Google Translate之类的在线翻译工具每天都可能发生巨大变化。这让我感到惊讶，对于那些依赖机器翻译的人来说，可能值得一提。</p><p> This is also a good demonstration of what Japanese-to-English machine translations can look and sound like and can help others identify when a game uses a machine translation. Some real-life examples:</p><p> 这也很好地说明了日语到英语的机器翻译的外观和声音，并可以帮助其他人识别游戏何时使用机器翻译。一些真实的例子：</p><p>   Going into this experiment, I didn’t have high hopes for the quality of the text, but I tried to set that assumption aside. The result so far has been incredibly funny, and it’s been a blast to play live on stream with fellow fans. I stream Legends of Localizaton projects  here from time to time, but if you’re reading this much later, you can catch the archived stream playlist  here:</p><p>   进行此实验时，我对文本的质量没有很高的期望，但我尝试将这一假设搁置一旁。到目前为止，结果令人难以置信，非常有趣，这是与其他粉丝一起直播直播的热潮。我会不时在这里流式传输“本地传奇”项目，但如果您稍后阅读，则可以在此处捕获已存档的流播放列表：</p><p>   Basically, all the fancy-pants college talk aside, this machine-translated version of  Final Fantasy IV is just one piece of a bunch of other things I’ve wanted to take a stab at for years. While I don’t plan on updating the translation patches any further, this project is something I’ll probably toy with for years to come, and hopefully others will find it fun and educational too. For now, it’s just a nice, goofy thing to sit back and enjoy.</p><p>   基本上，除所有关于高级裤子的演讲外，这款机器翻译的《最终幻想IV》只是我多年来一直想尝试的一堆其他东西中的一部分。尽管我不打算进一步更新翻译补丁，但这个项目可能会在以后的几年中成为我的玩具，希望其他人也能从中找到乐趣和教育意义。就目前而言，坐下来享受它只是一件很愚蠢的事情。</p><p>  Did you do this before or after Google’s big switch to the neural net machine translation engine?</p><p>  您是在Google转向神经网络机器翻译引擎之前还是之后进行此操作的？ </p><p> By some stroke of fate, I have builds from before AND after the translation engine changed! The initial translation was done on or around Dec. 4, 2016. The next night, I noticed that Google Translate was suddenly translating everything very differently, so I made another build using the new translation. I was completely unaware that such a big change was planned or underway at Google.</p><p>命运的stroke折，使我在翻译引擎改变之前和之后都建立了！最初的翻译是在2016年12月4日前后完成的。第二天晚上，我注意到Google Translate突然翻译了所有内容，因此我使用新翻译制作了另一个版本。我完全不知道Google计划或正在进行如此巨大的变革。</p><p>  Version 1 of the translation is pretty bad for the most part, except when it comes to small pieces of text like item names and descriptions. It chokes on the main script, especially all of the “entertainment Japanese” that the script uses, so it’s pretty funny. Most sentences are just nonsensical random words strewn together, but when a logical sentence appears it usually results in something amusing. Version 1 does seem to handle “proper Japanese” sentences just fine, however.</p><p>  除了涉及诸如项目名称和描述之类的小段文字外，翻译的第1版在大多数情况下都是很糟糕的。它扼杀了主脚本，尤其是脚本使用的所有“娱乐日语”，因此非常有趣。大多数句子只是杂乱无章的随机单词，但是当逻辑句子出现时，通常会导致一些有趣的事情。但是，第1版似乎确实可以处理“适当的日语”句子。</p><p> Version 2 of the translation is also pretty bad, but in a different way. This version has logically-constructed sentences, but the actual phrase/word/term choices themselves are often far worse than Version 1. “Proper Japanese” sentences translate poorly compared to Version 1. Overall, this translation is much more playable than Version 1. The logical-sounding nonsense is also very entertaining, but many script lines are molded in a way that obscures the intention of the original lines. With Version 1, you can at least see some keywords in the script and get a basic idea of what’s going on. Version 2 pales in comparison in this regard.</p><p> 翻译的第2版也很糟糕，但使用的方式有所不同。此版本具有逻辑构造的句子，但实际的短语/单词/术语选择本身通常比版本1差得多。与版本1相比，“日语”句子的翻译效果较差。总体而言，此翻译比版本1的可播放性好得多。听起来听起来很合乎逻辑的废话也很有趣，但是许多脚本行的模制却掩盖了原始行的意图。在第1版中，您至少可以在脚本中看到一些关键字，并对发生的事情有基本的了解。在这方面，版本2相形见pale。</p><p>       Four years after my Google Translate experiments, I ran  Final Fantasy IV through a supposedly more sophisticated machine translation engine named DeepL. The results aren’t as funny or crazy as the Google Translate versions, but they’re still very entertaining. You can download the DeepL translation patch  here.</p><p>       在完成Google翻译实验四年之后，我通过一个名为DeepL的据称更为复杂的机器翻译引擎运行了《最终幻想IV》。结果虽然不如Google翻译版本有趣或疯狂，但它们仍然非常有趣。您可以在此处下载DeepL翻译补丁。</p><p>    I actually did do a full playthrough of a Google-translated  Final Fantasy VI, which you can read about  here. I don’t have any other serious plans for other games at the moment, but I think it’d be fun to keep using  Final Fantasy IV every few years to see how much Google Translate improves.</p><p>    实际上，我确实完成了Google翻译的《最终幻想VI》的完整播放，您可以在这里阅读有关内容。我目前还没有其他游戏的认真计划，但我认为每隔几年继续使用Final Fantasy IV来看看Google Translate的改进是很有趣的。</p><p>  If you liked this, check out   press start to translate, my book about the time I Google-translated  Final Fantasy IV.
