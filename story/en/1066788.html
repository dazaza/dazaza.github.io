For in-depth profiles and founder interviews released every 2 weeks – subscribe below:</p><p>欢迎来到未来的状态：保险，我们档案初创公司重写保险的未来。对于每2周发布的深入配置文件和创始人访谈 - 订阅以下：</p><p>       If you’ve followed insurtech for more than a week, you’ve probably read about embedded insurance. That is, incorporating insurance point-of-sales directly into the purchase flow of the asset you’re trying to insure. It’s an incredibly effective distribution channel.</p><p>       如果您已遵循insurech超过一周，您可能已阅读嵌入式保险。也就是说，将保险销售额直接纳入您试图确保的资产的购买流程。这是一个令人难以置信的有效的分销渠道。</p><p> While other companies like  Boost Insurance are trying to make it easy for retailers (e.g. an online used car marketplace) to offer insurance, Wrapbook is taking a verticalized approach: not only is Wrapbook providing a unique payroll product for project-based industries, they’re also a licensed insurance agency.</p><p> 虽然像提升保险等其他公司试图使零售商（例如在线使用的汽车市场）轻松提供保险，但是Wrapbook正在采取垂直的方法：不仅是联系书为基于项目的工业提供独特的工资单产品，它们'还有许可的保险机构。</p><p> Wrapbook, at its core, is trying to answer:  how do you make it as easy as possible for project-based industries (e.g. entertainment) to manage their operations? These are industries that cycle through a freelance workforce and where each project requires a unique set of insurance policies that range from workers comp to production insurance to temporary fleet insurance.</p><p> Wrapbook，在其核心，正在努力回答：您如何使基于项目的工业（例如娱乐）来管理他们的操作？这些是通过自由职业劳动力循环的行业，每个项目需要一系列独特的保险政策，这些政策范围从工人Comp到临时舰队保险的生产保险。</p><p> Wrapbook takes a network-based approach, accumulating a network of project-based workers who cycle through a set of similar employers. If it all works, Wrapbook’s feedback loops can snowball into becoming the first digital-first payroll software for the entertainment industry and sophisticated production insurance underwriters – taking cuts out of the $181b entertainment payroll space and the $17b entertainment insurance space in the process.</p><p> WrapBook采用基于网络的方法，累积了一系列类似雇主的项目的工人网络。如果这一切都有效，Wrapbook的反馈循环可以成为娱乐业和复杂的生产保险承销商的第一个数字第一工资软件 - 以181亿美元的娱乐工资空间和17亿美元的娱乐保险空间。</p><p>     The entertainment industry relies heavily on a freelance workforce. With each new project, production companies need to onboard and pay new employees and get together a slew of insurance policies.</p><p>     娱乐业严重依赖自由职业队伍。随着每个新项目，生产公司需要船上，并支付新员工并聚集一下保险单。</p><p> Entertainment companies (e.g. movies, television, broadway, music tours) are businesses that face the same hiring needs and liabilities as all others. However, what’s unique here is that the entertainment industry inherently relies on a freelance workforce that cycles through multiple employers a year. For every project – whether that’s a movie, a television show, a commercial, or a broadway play – the production company needs to hire, onboard, insure, and pay their employees.</p><p> 娱乐公司（例如电影，电视，百老汇，音乐之旅）是面对与其他所有人相同的招聘需求和负债的业务。然而，这里是独一无二的，即娱乐业本身依赖于一年内循环的自由职业员工。对于每个项目 - 无论是这部电影，电视节目，商业还是百老汇比赛 - 生产公司需要雇用，船上，保险和支付员工。 </p><p> Today, classically, the payroll process for entertainment and project-based work is riddled with a lot of tedium. You’d onboard everyone with paper. You’d scan it and send it to a company who would process it. That company, in return, sends you a very long workers comp questionnaire. (Ali Javid, CEO, Wrapbook)</p><p>今天，经典上，娱乐和基于项目的工作的工资单进程充满了大量的乏味。你用纸上的每个人。您可以扫描它并将其发送给将处理它的公司。作为回报，该公司送给你一个非常长的工人Comp调查问卷。 （Ali Javid，CEO，Wrapbook）</p><p> Given the project-based nature of the workforce in the entertainment industry, traditional payroll processors do not operate here. Payroll processing within the entertainment industry, consequently, has historically been a very manual and laborious process. (Richard Kerby, Partner, Equal Ventures)</p><p> 鉴于娱乐行业的劳动力的基于项目的性质，传统的工资工具在此处不操作。因此，娱乐行业内的工资单处理历史上一直是一个非常手动和费力的过程。 （Richard Kerby，合作伙伴，同等企业）</p><p> Moreover, just as a production company needs to hire their employees with each project, they also need a whole new set of insurance policies. Production companies, after all, rent out locations and work with very expensive equipment such as top-of-the-shelf cameras or rental cars. These production companies need a variety of policies such as general liability, rental equipment coverage, 3rd party property insurance, and auto liability for non-owned vehicles.</p><p> 此外，正如生产公司需要与每个项目雇用员工，他们也需要一系列新的保险单。生产企业毕竟，租用地点，并使用非常昂贵的设备，如顶级摄像头或租车。这些生产公司需要各种各样的政策，如一般责任，租赁设备覆盖，第三方财产保险以及非拥有车辆的汽车责任。</p><p>   Wrapbook provides a 10x better product experience by allowing production companies to hire and pay their project-based workers and insure them digitally. Employers can populate all of their workers’ information, share job details with them, input wage rates, and outsource all other information collected on their workforce into the Wrapbook platform. Wrapbook is the first platform to embrace the worker, enabling them to create and own their digital profile. (Richard Kerby, Partner, Equal Ventures)</p><p>   Wrapbook通过允许生产公司雇用并支付基于项目的工人并以数字方式确保它们来提供10倍更好的产品体验。雇主可以填充所有工人的信息，与他们共享工作详细信息，输入工资率，并将其员工收集的所有其他信息外包到包装簿平台上。 WrapBook是第一个拥抱工人的平台，使他们能够创建和拥有他们的数字档案。 （Richard Kerby，合作伙伴，同等企业）</p><p>  As part of the payroll offering, Wrapbook enables employers to efficiently onboard employees, with auto-generated contracts and employment forms, and eSignatures. Importantly, when employees onboard onto Wrapbook, they only need to onboard  once (which is the foundation of Wrapbook’s network-based approach).</p><p>  作为工资单提供的一部分，Wrapbook使雇主能够有效地船上雇员，具有自动生成的合同和就业表格和伊斯尼亚廷。重要的是，当员工船上的卡图上时，他们只需要船上一次（这是面包簿的基于网络的方法的基础）。</p><p> Wrapbook’s payroll system is compliant with labor, union, and guild rules and will auto-generate all the appropriate tax filings. Moreover, Wrapbook has built-in time-tracking with all the payment reporting easily traceable. Built for the entertainment industry, Wrapbook helps employers organize their payroll on a project basis.</p><p> Wrapbook的薪资系统符合劳动力，联盟和公会规则，并将自动生成所有适当的税务申请。此外，Wrapbook拥有内置的时间跟踪，所有支付报告都很容易可追溯。 Wrapbook为娱乐行业建造，帮助雇主根据项目组织其工资单。</p><p>  When it comes to the network aspect, the employee Wrapbook profile enables  other employers to swiftly and effortlessly onboard those employees. So, if two employers are both using Wrapbook, employees do not need to make a new account or be onboarded differently each time. This network-based helps with organic growth:</p><p>  涉及到网络方面时，员工包装文件可以迅速而毫不费力地播放这些员工。因此，如果两个雇主都使用了WrapBook，员工每次都不需要制作新帐户或以不同的方式在旁边。这种基于网络的有助于有机增长： </p><p> Workers receiving payment through Wrapbook is a much nicer way as an employee to manage their payments. They’re able to bring their profile to the next employer. Employees  want to be paid through Wrapbook and they tell their next employer exactly this. At the time when we raised our Series A, 12% of users had used their Wrapbook profile across more than one employer. (Cameron Woodward, CMO, Wrapbook)</p><p>通过Wrapbook收到付款的工人是管理其付款的员工的更好方式。他们能够将他们的个人资料带到下一个雇主。员工希望通过Wrapbook付款，他们完全告诉他们的下一个雇主。在我们提出的A系列A中，12％的用户在以上的雇主中使用了他们的书记文件。 （卡梅隆伍德沃德，CMO，Wrapbook）</p><p> On the insurance side, Wrapbook acts as an insurance agency selling general liability to cover 3rd party injury and damage and errors &amp; omissions, rental equipment coverage, 3rd party property insurance (when renting out locations), and hired &amp; non-owned auto policies (for the vehicles used in production). Workers compensation is bundled directly into the payroll.</p><p> 在保险方面，套件作为保险代理商出售一般责任，以涵盖第三方伤害和损害和错误＆amp;遗漏，租赁设备覆盖范围，第三方房地产保险（租用地点时），并聘用＆amp;非拥有汽车策略（用于生产中使用的车辆）。工人赔偿直接捆绑在工资单中。</p><p> Wrapbook offers  annual DICE policies for companies that shoot multiple productions in a year. This doesn’t apply to major feature film shoots (where a separate company is typically set up specifically for that film). With a DICE policy, the employer doesn’t have to negotiate on a per-project basis. Wrapbook annual policies start at  $2,250 (typical policies range from $3,000 to $25,000).</p><p> WrapBook为每年拍摄多项产品的公司提供年度骰子政策。这不适用于主要特征电影射击（其中一个单独的公司通常专门为该电影设置）。凭借骰子政策，雇主不必按照按项目进行谈判。 Wrapbook年度政策起价为2,250美元（典型政策范围从3,000美元到25,000美元）。</p><p> Our system understands the risks associated with each project. We understand the location, all the workers from the producers to the safety set coordinators to the gaffers, electricians, etc. All of a sudden, we’re able to start monitoring risk, not only at the project level, but at the worker level. This person seems to sprain their ankle a lot. We understand the risks associated with each project and we can reject bad risk. (Ali Javid, CEO, Wrapbook)</p><p> 我们的系统理解与每个项目相关的风险。我们了解该地点，所有工人从生产者到安全设定协调员到扶手，电工等突然间，我们都能够开始监测风险，不仅在项目层面，而且在工人级别。这个人似乎很扭伤他们的脚踝。我们了解与每个项目相关的风险，我们可以拒绝风险不佳。 （Ali Javid，CEO，Wrapbook）</p><p> Wrapbook’s network-based approach goes as follows: the more employers on the platform, the more (portable) worker profiles, which in turn leads to more data to underwrite with and more employers to onboard (as workers move from project to project). Down the line, with an abundance of data, Wrapbook can offer better financial services, attracting more employers onto the platform.</p><p> Wrapbook的基于网络的方法如下：平台上的雇主越多，越多（便携）的工作人员配置文件，又导致更多数据以与船上交易和更多雇主（工人从项目移动到项目）。在线，随着丰富的数据，Wrapbook可以提供更好的金融服务，吸引更多雇主进入平台。</p><p>  Looking at its payroll business alone, Wrapbook doesn’t need to carve out the largest chunk of the market to become a $1b business. Add in the additional revenue Wrapbook can generate from its insurance policies and it has a more promising path to become a $1b business.</p><p>  单独查看其工资单业，Wrapbook不需要雕刻出市场的最大块，成为1亿美元的业务。加入额外的收入包装簿可以从其保险单产生，并且有一个更有前途的道路，成为1亿美元的业务。</p><p>  Payroll TAM: Wrapbook’s charges 1.5% of union wages paid through its platform and receives a commission on DICE policies sold. The U.S. film and television industry supports  2.5 million workers and pays out over  $181b in wages annually. Simple math tells us Wrapbook has a  payroll TAM of $2.7b.</p><p>  Payroll TAM：Wrapbook的收费1.5％的工会通过其平台支付的工资，并获得销售的骰子政策委员会。美国电影电视行业支持250万名工人，每年工资超过181亿美元。简单的数学告诉我们有2.7亿美元的薪资TAM。 </p><p> Entertainment Insurance TAM: The entertainment insurance industry is a  $17b market in the U.S. At a 15% commission, Wrapbook has an insurance TAM of $2.6b.</p><p>娱乐保险TAM：娱乐保险业为美国17亿美元的市场，在15％的佣金中，Wrapbook有一个2.6亿美元的保险TAM。</p><p>  Looking at Wrapbook solely as a payroll software company: Incumbent payroll providers vary widely from 5.5x (ADP) to ~19.5x (Paycom). Assuming Wrapbook trades at a more favorable multiple of 10x, to be valued at $1b, Wrapbook would need to generate $100m in revenue, or 3.7% of Wrapbook’s  payroll TAM – bumping that to a 20x revenue multiple, Wrapbook would only need to capture ~1.9% of the market.</p><p>  仅作为Payroll软件公司查看Wrapbook：现任工资供应商从5.5倍（ADP）到〜19.5x（PAYCOM）不同。假设Wrapbook交易在10倍的更有利的倍数，估价为1亿美元，需要在收入100米之前生成100米，或3.7％的包装簿的薪酬TAM  - 将其达到20倍的收入，包装簿只需要捕获〜1.9％的市场。</p><p> Wrapbook could well have a path to a $1b valuation with its payroll business model alone. If its network-based strategy works, it would have a customer acquisition flywheel. Wrapbook’s revenue from its insurance commissions is the icing on the cake here. In a vacuum, Wrapbook won’t be valued as  just a payroll company (insurance agencies trade at  ~3x revenue to ~4x like AJG, which would likely bring Wrapbook’s  overall multiple down). With the multiple revenue streams, we could see Wrapbook having multiple paths to a $1b valuation without having to rely on its payroll business alone.</p><p> Wrapbook可以单独使用其工资单位估价为1亿美元的估价。如果其基于网络的战略工作，它将有一个客户获取飞轮。 Wrapbook从其保险委员会的收入是在这里锦上添花。在真空中，WrapBook不会被评估为薪资公司（保险机构在〜3倍的收入贸易到〜4倍，〜4倍，可能会使Wrapbook的整体倍数下来）。通过多个收入流，我们可以看到有多个路径到1亿美元估值的人士，而无需单独依赖其工资单。</p><p> Moreover, Wrapbook’s problems, in the abstract, don’t apply to just the entertainment industry. There are  59 million freelance workers in the U.S. (or ~36% of the U.S. workforce). These problems can extend to industries such as construction that have their own set of unique liabilities. If they find that the network-based playbook works for the entertainment industry, they now have a playbook that could work for other industries such as construction, staffing, as well as, maids and nannies – all of which would greatly expand Wrapbook’s TAM.</p><p> 此外，包装上的问题，在摘要中，不适用于娱乐业。美国有5900万个自由工人工作者（或〜36％的美国劳动力）。这些问题可以扩展到建筑等行业，这些行业具有自己的独特责任。如果他们发现基于网络的PlayBook为娱乐业工作，他们现在有一个可以为建筑，人员和女仆和保姆等其他行业工作的剧本 - 所有这些行业都会大大扩大包装簿的TAM。</p><p> Wrapbook’s potential seems quite clear. It’s operating in an antiquated industry burdened by paperwork. Though, it could be something much more. By being the focal point of interaction, Wrapbook is gathering  continual risk profiles on its workers and employers. Wrapbook’s payroll software enables it to have multiple touchpoints with the insured throughout their employment lifecycle and across employers. Through scale and enough data, Wrapbook could move out of the agency model and create a differentiated insurance offering altogether.</p><p> 面包簿的潜力似乎很清楚。它以陈旧的行业运作，由文书工作负担。虽然，它可能会更多。通过互动的焦点来看，Wrapbook正在为其工人和雇主提供持续的风险概况。 WrapBook的Payroll软件使其能够在整个就业生命周期和跨越雇主中拥有多个接触点。通过规模和足够的数据，包装书可以退出代理模型，并创建一个完全差异的保险。</p><p> Wrapbook may not only become  the place for entertainment payroll. With their embedded insurance play, they may well become  the place for entertainment insurance. Employers will come for the payroll, but they’ll stay for the insurance.</p><p> 包装书可能不仅成为娱乐薪资的地方。随着他们的嵌入式保险，他们可能会成为娱乐保险的地方。雇主将获得薪资，但他们会留下保险。</p><p>  Thank you to  Ali Javid and  Cameron Woodward of Wrapbook, as well as,  Richard Kerby of Equal Ventures.</p><p>  谢谢你的javid和卡梅伦伍德沃特的书记，以及Richard Kerby的平等企业。 </p><p>           Have any other questions, comments, or feedback?
