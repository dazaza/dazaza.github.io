They’re often deemed critical by company leadership and various stakeholders, and it’s validating to be trusted with and attached to something so visible and impactful.</p><p> 在这些大项目上工作可能会令人振奋。他们经常被公司领导和各种利益攸关方视为批评，它验证了与如此可见和影响的东西相信。</p><p> I recently shipped two things at GitHub that had an impact beyond my wildest dreams. The amount of gratitude and love that spilled out of the community is like nothing I’ve seen before.But the things I shipped weren’t these huge, meaty projects. They were  tiny.</p><p> 我最近在Github上发了两件事，这会影响我最疯狂的梦想。在社区中溢出的感激之情和爱情就像我以前见过的那样。但是我发货的东西并不是这些巨大的多功能项目。他们很小。</p><p>  First,  we made the favicons for GitHub Pull Request pages dynamic. Now browser tabs will always show a PR’s current build status. Before releasing this, users had to periodically click back into tabs to see if their builds had completed so they could continue their work. Impatient users would click back into various PR tabs a  lot.</p><p>  首先，我们为GitHub拉出请求页面动态制作了Favicons。现在浏览器选项卡将始终显示PR的当前构建状态。在发布之前，用户必须定期点击选项卡，以查看其构建是否已完成，以便他们继续工作。不耐烦的用户会在很多批次中单击“重选”。</p><p>  I put together new favicons and Jason worked on implementing the dynamic switch. This change took less than a week, and hundreds of people noticed it immediately. This is just a small sample of the many delighted responses.</p><p>  我把新的Favicons和Jason放在了实施动态开关上。这种变化不到一周，数百人立即注意到。这只是许多高兴的反应的一个小样本。</p><p>  My next project was  changing the  ... indicator on new PR pages to an arrow that indicated merge direction. Before releasing this, people would regularly confuse which branch would be merged into which.</p><p>  我的下一个项目正在将新PR页面上的...指标更改为指示合并方向的箭头。在发布此之前，人们会定期混淆哪个分支将合并到其中。</p><p> Ever get confused between your “base” and “compare” branches? Shipped a tiny  @github change today that will hopefully clear things up.  pic.twitter.com/acOddhxLDs</p><p> 你的“基地”和“比较”分支机构之间感到困惑？今天发货了一个微小的@github改变，希望能够清楚的事情。 pic.twitter.com/acoddhxlds. </p><p>— Joel Califa (@notdetails)  December 4, 2017</p><p>-  2017年12月4日的Joel Califa（@Notdetails）</p><p> This was a one-line code change that took a few minutes. I didn’t even design the arrow — it was already in our icon set.</p><p> 这是一行代码变更，花了几分钟。我甚至没有设计箭头 - 它已经在我们的图标集中。</p><p> This tiny change solved a seemingly small frustration, but it turned out to be very significant to many of our users. Again, we saw hundreds of enthusiastic responses and shares.</p><p> 这种微小的改变解决了一个看似小的挫折感，但事实证明对我们的许多用户来说非常重要。再次，我们看到了数百家热情的反应和股票。</p><p>   The first of these changes took just under a week and the second took only a few minutes. Both changes affected very small sections of the platform, yet both enjoyed a passionate, almost euphoric reception. Users were  excited.</p><p>   这些变化中的第一个也是在一周之下，第二个变化只花了几分钟。这两种变化都影响了平台的非常小的部分，但两者都享受了热情，几乎欣快的招待会。用户很兴奋。</p><p> That’s not to say that impact can or should be measured by the number of likes received (unlike, say, personal worth). But the individual responses tell a story of how meaningful even the smallest tweak can be to your users.</p><p> 这并不是说影响可以或应该通过收到的喜欢的数量来衡量（不同，说，个人价值）。但是，个人反应讲述了甚至最小的调整可以对您的用户有意义的故事。</p><p> I can’t count how many times I’ve seen the following graphic in its various forms over the years:</p><p> 多年来，我无法计算我在各种形式中看到以下图形的次数：</p><p>  The obvious advice, as seen in this version of it, is to execute on things that take little time and make big dents. Curiously, I haven’t seen many organizations actually take this advice to heart. Considering how valuable this type of work can be, I honestly don’t understand why.</p><p>  如在此版本所见的那样明显的建议是在需要一点时间和大凹痕的事情上执行。好奇地，我没有看到许多组织实际上将这个建议带到心里。考虑到这种类型的工作有多有价值，我真的不明白为什么。 </p><p>   High frequency actions (such as creating new PRs on GitHub) take place millions of times a day. A given user might go through the same flow several times per week, per day, or even per hour. These flows become a part of their lives.</p><p>高频动作（例如在GitHub上创建新的PRS）每天达到数百万次。给定用户可能每周几次，每天甚至每小时都经过同一流程。这些流动成为他们生命的一部分。</p><p> If there is even a slight inefficiency or frustration, it compounds with every use. One confusing moment that takes an extra 5 seconds—repeated multiple times a day in perpetuity—adds up to a lot of anxiety and wasted time.</p><p> 如果甚至有轻微的低效率或沮丧，每次使用都有化合物。一个令人困惑的时刻，在永恒的一天重复额外的5秒钟 - 在持续的时间里重复 - 增加了很多焦虑和浪费时间。</p><p> That’s why users are so thankful for these tweaks. They understand the significance of all that future time saved.</p><p> 这就是为什么用户这么感谢这些调整。他们了解所有未来时间保存的重要性。</p><p> We can see similar reactions after Netflix added a button that let users skip a TV show’s intro sequence. Following this change, users no longer had to scrub back and forth through videos until they landed on the exact start of an episode.</p><p> Netflix添加了类似的按钮，我们可以看到类似的反应，让用户跳过电视节目的介绍序列。在此更改之后，用户不再通过视频来回擦除，直到它们降落在集中的精确开始之前。</p><p>  We can see more responses along the same lines after Chrome released a volume icon that indicated which tabs were making noise. Following this change, users no longer had to click into every open tab to find the source of their discomfort.</p><p>  在Chrome发布的卷图标后，我们可以看到更多的响应，该卷图标表示指示哪些标签进行噪音。在此更改之后，用户不再不得不单击每个打开的选项卡以查找其不适的来源。</p><p>   There are many more examples of this kind of overwhelming gratitude following similar tweaks. The changes may seem minor, but they resolved frustrations that were experienced over and over by  millions of users.</p><p>   在类似的调整之后，这种压倒性感恩还有更多的例子。这些变化似乎很小，但他们解决了数百万用户经历的挫败感。</p><p> Imagine that one of your 20 Chrome tabs is currently auto-playing the most obnoxious video on the entire internet. The way you solve this is by trial-and-error clicking through every single tab. You didn’t find it the first time. How is that possible? Ugh, maybe you clicked into it without noticing. Let’s try again and again until finally, defeated, you close your entire browser. Rinse and repeat tomorrow and every other day for the foreseeable future.</p><p> 想象一下，您的20个Chrome标签中的一个目前正在自动播放整个互联网上最讨厌的视频。解决此操作的方式是通过每一个选项卡进行试用和错误。你第一次找不到它。那有可能吗？呃，也许你在没有注意到的情况下点击它。让我们再次尝试，直到最后，击败，你关闭了整个浏览器。明天和每隔一天都在明天和预定的未来重复。 </p><p>    You can think of the aforementioned changes as shortcuts. The intermediate steps (randomly clicking through your many tabs to find the source of your pain, or racking your brain for which git branch merges into which so you don’t accidentally break your company) are small paper cuts, but they add up. These changes get rid of them.</p><p>您可以将上述更改视为捷径。中间步骤（随机点击您的许多标签来找到疼痛的来源，或者将您的大脑置于哪个Git分支合并到其中，所以您不会意外地突破您的公司）是小剪纸，但他们加起来。这些变化摆脱了它们。</p><p> Getting your personal pet peeve fixed is powerful, often more so than new, more substantial features. Think about all that cumulative impact resulting from such little effort.</p><p> 让你的个人宠物Peeve固定是强大的，往往比新的，更实质的特征更为重要。想想这么少的努力所产生的所有累积影响。</p><p>   Let’s get this out of the way: large projects are important. If a company wants to continue innovating, tiny iterations like the ones above don’t quite cut it. So, to be clear, I’m not suggesting we begin planning roadmaps around these Tiny Wins. Ambitious projects should lead the way.</p><p>   让我们竭尽全力：大型项目很重要。如果公司想要继续创新，那就像上面的那样的微小迭代并不完全削减它。所以，要清楚，我并不是暗示我们开始规划围绕这些小胜利的路线图。雄心勃勃的项目应该引领方式。</p><p> But large scale projects demand coordination, diligence, and — most of all — time. These things don’t happen overnight. In the time it takes to ship something of substance, a product can begin to feel stagnant. For a startup (especially one with viable competition) that stagnation can spell death.</p><p> 但大规模的项目需求协调，勤奋，以及大多数时间。这些事情过夜不会发生。在运送某些物质的时间时，产品可以开始感到停滞。对于启动（尤其是具有可行竞争的竞争），停滞可以拼命死亡。</p><p> To combat this, companies have to create an atmosphere of momentum, and prove to their users that they’re both listening and improving. They need to fill the long gaps between ambitious launches with smaller ships.</p><p> 为了打击这一点，公司必须创造一个势头的氛围，并向他们的用户证明他们都在倾听和改进。他们需要填补雄心勃勃的发射之间的长差距，船只较小的船只。</p><p> Many companies try to strike a balance by building MVPs and iterating from there. This, ideally, provides users with regular value along every step of the way. But each of these steps can still take anywhere from a two-week sprint to several months—and the output of each step is not always inherently valuable. It’s often the next small thing on the way to a more complete product.</p><p> 许多公司试图通过建立MVPS并从那里迭代来达到平衡。理想情况下，这为用户提供了常规值的每一步。但这些步骤中的每一个仍然可以从两周的冲刺到几个月到几个月 - 并且每个步骤的输出并不总是有价值的。在进入更完整的产品的路上，它通常是下一个小事。</p><p> In contrast, the various improvements I listed above are all self-contained. Netflix’s “skip intro” button is significant to users  in itself. As is Chrome’s noise indicators and GitHub’s dynamic favicons.</p><p> 相比之下，上面列出的各种改进是全部包含的。 Netflix的“Skip Intro”按钮本身对用户很重要。作为Chrome的噪音指示灯和GitHub的动态Favicon。 </p><p> Because of this, these changes were perceived and acknowledged as fresh, complete features. They communicated to users that  they were being listened to. These features bred excitement, goodwill, and likely loyalty towards their respective companies. Hell, they probably even contributed to some organic growth.</p><p>因此，这些变化被认为并被承认为新鲜，完整的功能。他们传达给他们被听到的用户。这些功能赋予兴奋，善意和对各自的公司的忠诚度。地狱，他们甚至可能导致一些有机增长。</p><p> MVPs and iteration are powerful tools that should be leveraged by companies looking to move quickly. But Tiny Wins are much more potent when it comes to filling the gaps, improving retention, and nurturing your community of users.</p><p> MVPS和迭代是强大的工具，应该通过寻求快速移动的公司利用。但是，在填补差距，改善保留和培养您的用户社区时，小胜胜更有效。</p><p>  OK, so Tiny Wins are great and they have this cute name to boot. Obviously you’re sold on this. The next step, then, is to leverage them regularly and reap the rewards.</p><p>  好的，这么小的胜利很棒，他们有这个可爱的名字来启动。显然你已经卖了这一点。然后，下一步是定期利用它们并获得奖励。</p><p> Now, your first instinct might be to open up your user feedback channels and start prioritizing issues. I’d caution against this.</p><p> 现在，您的第一个本能可能是打开您的用户反馈渠道并开始优先考虑问题。我谨慎对待这一点。</p><p> I noticed something weird about the issues we solved with these changes. They were almost never reported.</p><p> 关于我们解决这些变化的问题，我注意到了一些奇怪的问题。他们几乎从未报道过。</p><p> Hundreds of people were ecstatic when we added that arrow to PR pages. Out of those, not a single one indicated that this flow was confusing. A lot of people assumed it was their own fault for not just “getting” it.</p><p> 当我们将箭头添加到公关页面时，数百人是欣喜若狂的。在那些之外，不是一个人表示这种流动令人困惑。很多人认为这是他们自己的错，不仅仅是“得到”它。</p><p>  Others get so accustomed to these flows that they don’t even notice their anxiety. If they do, it’s just part of life. The status quo. Something to live with, not improve.</p><p>  其他人习惯于这些流动，他们甚至没有注意到他们的焦虑。如果他们这样做，这只是生命的一部分。现状。有些东西，没有改善。 </p><p> How many people recognized the act of scrubbing a video to find the start of an episode as improvable? How many people thought to ask the Chrome team to solve their noisy tab problems?</p><p>有多少人认识到擦洗视频的行为，以找到剧集的开始作为可易济的？有多少人想问Chrome团队解决他们嘈杂的标签问题？</p><p>  The lesson here is that you can’t trust your users to bubble up the small stuff, which as we’ve seen can often be the best stuff to build). This means that you can’t exclusively rely on existing user feedback and tickets. You need to dig deeper.</p><p>  这里的课程是您无法相信您的用户冒出泡沫的小东西，因为我们所看到的，我们通常可以成为建立的最佳东西）。这意味着您无法完全依赖现有的用户反馈和票证。你需要深入挖掘。</p><p>  Making a list of quick wins isn’t hard, but making sure that what you’re building is worth the effort can be trickier. Not every opportunity will have the kind of impact we saw above, and that’s what Tiny Wins are all about.</p><p>  制作一个快速胜利的清单并不难，但确保你建造的是值得努力的努力可能是棘手的。不是每一个机会都会有我们看到的那种影响，这就是微小的胜利。</p><p> Tiny Wins are standalone. These changes are small, scoped, and provide their own value. If the change can’t be appreciated on its own, it doesn’t belong on the list.</p><p> 微小的胜利是独立的。这些变化很小，范围，并提供自己的价值。如果无法自己欣赏更改，则它不属于列表。</p><p> Tiny Wins are low effort. These projects are straightforward, scoped, and takes a short amount of time. If the change requires a significant amount of time and effort, it doesn’t belong on the list.</p><p> 小胜的努力很低。这些项目很简单，范围，并且需要很短的时间。如果更改需要大量的时间和精力，则它不属于列表。</p><p> Tiny Wins are high impact. They affect things that the majority of users interact with on a regular basis. If the change won’t have the compounding effects we’ve discussed, it doesn’t belong on the list. This means that something like addressing your system’s  dark corners, while important and worthwhile, is not right for this list.</p><p> 微小的胜利效果很高。他们影响大多数用户定期互动的事情。如果更改不会具有我们讨论的复合效果，则它不属于列表。这意味着类似于解决系统的黑暗角落的东西，而重要性和值得，这是不对这个清单。</p><p> Tiny Wins are often shortcuts. They save a user’s time by getting rid of existing steps —  physical or mental — required to perform an action. This is a really useful way to think about the types of changes we saw above, and a good way to differentiate them from other low-hanging fruits that don’t belong on your lists. At least initially, users will still remember the frustrating experiences they once had to deal with. They’ll remember them viscerally. That’s where the love comes from.</p><p> 微小的胜利通常是捷径。他们通过摆脱现有的步骤 - 物理或心理来保存用户的时间 - 需要执行动作。这是一种考虑我们上面看到的改变类型的一种非常有用的方法，以及将它们与其他不属于您的列表中的其他低悬垂的水果区分开来的好方法。至少最初，用户仍然会记住他们曾经处理过的令人沮丧的经历。他们会记得他们真实的。这就是爱情来自的地方。 </p><p>  So start by setting up a meeting with as many perspectives as you can. Designers, Developers, PMs, Customer Success, and Support staff all have equally valuable insights here, but anyone with a finger on the pulse of your user base is especially important. Ask yourselves:</p><p>所以首先与尽可能多的角度来开始会议。设计师，开发人员，PMS，客户成功，以及支持人员在此处都有同样有价值的见解，但在用户群的脉冲上有一个手指的人尤为重要。问你自己：</p><p> What about those flows is frustrating? What regularly takes up time or cognitive load? This could be an extra click or an ambiguous component.</p><p> 那些流动令人沮丧的是什么？多么经常占用时间或认知负荷？这可能是一个额外的单击或模糊组件。</p><p> How frustrating are these moments? What is the sum of time or frustration that fixing each of these small things will save? How many users would be affected?</p><p> 这些时刻有多令人沮丧？修复这些小型的时间或挫折的总和是节省的？有多少用户会受到影响？</p><p> Fresh eyes are extremely useful when it comes to answering these questions. I’d only been at GitHub for a few months when I added the arrow to the PR page, and I did that because it just  didn’t make sense to me.</p><p> 在回答这些问题时，新鲜的眼睛非常有用。当我将箭头添加到PR页面时，我只在Github上了几个月，所以我这样做是因为它只是对我有意义。</p><p> Designers, like users, get used to their product and its various quirks. In time, it can become increasingly difficult to see what could be improved. So try to include new employees in this process. Make it a part of your team’s on-boarding. And nurture an atmosphere that encourages your team to continue questioning the status quo even as they get to know the product.</p><p> 设计师，如用户，习惯他们的产品及其各种怪癖。及时，可以越来越难以看出可以改善什么。所以尝试在这个过程中包括新员工。使其成为您团队的登机单。并培养一个鼓励您团队继续质疑现状的氛围，即使他们了解产品。</p><p> Once you’ve populated the initial list, you can validate individual items with users and prioritize them based on effort/impact, as you would anything else.</p><p> 填充初始列表后，您可以使用用户验证单个项目，并根据努力/影响，优先考虑它们，因为您可以。</p><p>  Every organization is different, so there isn’t a universal process that’ll work for everything. What I  can say is that the key element to make this work is a regular cadence. This is what will create a sense that the company is listening and moving quickly. This is what will breed trust in your user base.</p><p>  每个组织都不同，因此没有一个普遍的过程，可以为一切工作。我所能说的是，使这项工作的关键要素是常规的节奏。这是公司会迅速倾听和移动的感觉。这是对用户群中的信任策略。 </p><p> Include a Tiny Win in every sprint, or fill your downtime by picking items off the list. Make sure these tweaks are shipped frequently.</p><p>在每个Sprint中都包括小型胜利，或通过从列表中挑选物品来填充您的停机时间。确保使用这些调整频繁发货。</p><p> Keep the list alive by including new people, adding new items to it, revalidating it, and reprioritizing it often.</p><p> 通过包括新人来保持清单，并将新物品添加到它，重新验证，并经常重新恢复。</p><p> Make it a point to include your social media managers early in the conversation. Highlighting these features the right way is extremely important, and also fun!</p><p> 使其成为在谈话中提前包含您的社交媒体管理人员。突出显示这些功能，正确的方式非常重要，而且也有趣！</p><p>  I believe that getting into the habit of shipping Tiny Wins can do wonders for your brand. It can set you apart from competitors. It can show your users that you’re listening to them and that they can trust you. It can turn those same users into promoters, boost your NPS, and lead to organic growth. Most importantly, it’ll make your product, and the lives of your users, that much better.</p><p>  我相信养成运输的习惯小胜可以为您的品牌做出奇迹。它可以让你与竞争对手分开。它可以显示您的用户，您正在聆听它们，他们可以信任您。它可以将这些相同的用户转化为启动子，提升您的NPS，并导致有机增长。最重要的是，它会使您的产品和用户的生命更好。</p><p>       Joel led Product Design at DigitalOcean.
