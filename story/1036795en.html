It feels like it is everywhere.</p><p>我不了解您，但我无法摆脱所有有关数字花园的话题。感觉到处都是。</p><p> Some examples:  Anne-Laure Le Cunff,  Maggie Appleton, and the rise of  Roam Research and the &#39;cult-like&#39; community behind it.</p><p> 例如：Anne-Laure Le Cunff，Maggie Appleton，以及Roam Research的兴起以及背后的“邪教”社区。</p><p>  The phrase &#34;digital garden&#34; is a metaphor for thinking about writing and creating that focuses less on the resulting &#34;showpiece&#34; and more on the process, care, and craft it takes to get there.</p><p>  “数字花园”一词是一个隐喻，用于思考写作和创作，而较少关注最终的“展示品”，而更多地关注到达此所需的过程，护理和工艺。</p><p> While not everybody has or works in a dirt garden, we all share a familiarity with the idea of what a garden is.</p><p> 虽然不是每个人都在土花园里工作，但我们所有人都对什么是花园这个概念很熟悉。</p><p> A digital garden for me is about moving away from the idea of a blog (or even a newsletter like this 😬), where the posts are displayed chronologically and with a focus on perfection. It becomes more about moving towards a curated resource where you, the owner, tries to surface what you think is most important.</p><p> 对我来说，数字花园就是要摆脱博客（甚至是像这样的时事通讯）的想法，在博客中，帖子按时间顺序显示，并且注重完美。变得越来越重要，是要转向一种精选资源，在这里您（所有者）将尝试展示您认为最重要的内容。</p><p> Personally I&#39;ve dipped in and out of the concept of personal digital gardens for years. I even remember opting for a wiki at one point as my personal blog (which I loved). This was a very long time ago and I no longer have evidence of this, sadly, or maybe thankfully!</p><p> 就我个人而言，多年来我一直涉猎个人数字花园的概念。我什至还记得曾经选择过一个Wiki作为我的个人博客（我很喜欢）。这是很久以前的事了，可悲的是，我也许再也没有证据了！</p><p> Over the years I&#39;ve created personal things online, then binned them, many times over. This really is down to my personal (lack of) discipline. The person inside me struggles to do a digital garden for my own personal website. I think I will get there one day, I&#39;ve made small steps by making  rosiesherry.com a Notion website.</p><p> 多年来，我在网上创建了个人物品，然后将它们分类很多次。这确实取决于我个人的（缺乏）纪律。我内心的人努力为自己的个人网站打造数字花园。我想有一天我会到达那里，我已经将rosiesherry.com设置为Notion网站迈出了很小的一步。</p><p> However, when it comes to building community I&#39;ve taken a very different mindset. As I was building up Ministry of Testing I knew that the discussions, information, and talks we recorded were all valuable resources that deserved to be preserved and shared in some kind of useful way.</p><p>但是，在建立社区方面，我采取了截然不同的态度。当我建立测试部时，我知道我们记录的讨论，信息和谈话都是宝贵的资源，应该以某种有用的方式加以保存和共享。</p><p> 🎉  I realize now that my thinking has been in line with creating a community digital garden.</p><p> now现在，我意识到我的想法与创建社区数字花园是一致的。</p><p>  A community garden is a single piece of land gardened collectively by a group of people.</p><p>  社区花园是一群人共同园艺的一块土地。</p><p>  Ironically, I went to Google (then to land on Wikipedia) to search the meaning of &#39;community garden&#39; to then realize that Wikipedia is probably the best example of a community digital garden out there.</p><p>  具有讽刺意味的是，我去了Google（然后登陆Wikipedia）以搜索“社区花园”的含义，然后意识到Wikipedia可能是那里的社区数字花园的最好例子。</p><p>  However, in all seriousness, when thinking about a community digital garden, it can be easy to get carried away thinking that we have to have a wiki (or some fancy Roam like community tool) to make it a true community digital garden, however, I don&#39;t think this has to be the case.</p><p>  但是，实际上，在考虑社区数字花园时，容易想到我们必须要有一个Wiki（或一些像社区工具这样的奇特漫游），才能使其真正成为社区数字花园，但是，我认为情况并非必须如此。</p><p> The more I try to think about this and try to convey the idea to you now, the more I think it is about the process and the intention to constantly surface value from within the community.</p><p> 我越想这件事，现在就想把这个想法传达给您，我就越想关于从社区内部不断体现价值的过程和意图。</p><p>  Things will look simple and clean to begin with, but can quickly become messy and disorganized.</p><p>  开始时看起来会很简单干净，但很快就会变得混乱和混乱。</p><p> When building a community it is easy to fall into the trap of getting measured by the number of posts, comments, or views, rather than the combined and potential value</p><p>建立社区时，很容易陷入以帖子，评论或视图的数量而不是组合的潜在价值来衡量的陷阱</p><p> It’s important to look at the long term value of content and what it means to your community</p><p> 重要的是要了解内容的长期价值及其对社区的意义</p><p> Members can easily default to (lazily) checking and posting from the homepage or forum, over taking time to search and discover</p><p> 成员可以很容易地默认（懒惰地）从主页或论坛进行检查和发布，而这需要花费一些时间进行搜索和发现</p><p> Educating your community about where you are heading is probably key to making it work as they can then hopefully align their actions to help you</p><p> 对社区进行有关您的前进方向的教育可能是使社区运转的关键，因为他们可以希望调整他们的行动以帮助您</p><p> It doesn&#39;t need to mean that everyone has access to add or edit everything, it&#39;s more about having some kind of commitment to creating continual value based on the contributions from the community</p><p> 并不一定意味着每个人都可以添加或编辑所有内容，而更多地是要根据社区的贡献做出某种承诺来创造持续的价值</p><p> I think we would all love it if community members willingly spent their time contributing and organizing awesome bits of content and knowledge. The reality is that mostly this doesn&#39;t happen, or it doesn&#39;t happen in the way you want. Sometimes it&#39;s just easier to invest in some kind of process and become the community leader for the process of surfacing what is valuable.</p><p> 我认为，如果社区成员愿意花费时间来贡献和组织令人敬畏的内容和知识，我们都会喜欢它。现实情况是，大多数情况不会发生，或者不会以您想要的方式发生。有时，在某种过程中进行投资并成为揭示有价值的过程的社区负责人会更容易。</p><p>  When people join communities it is often the case to mostly focus on sharing and discussing information that is trending right now. It can be hit and miss how interesting or valuable a piece of shared information is. It can also be hit or miss whether a discussion was posted in the right place.</p><p>  当人们加入社区时，通常通常将重点放在共享和讨论当前正在流行的信息上。可能会碰到或错过一条共享信息多么有趣或有价值。讨论是否在正确的位置发布也可能会引起轰动或错过。</p><p> In addition to this, often community members need time to lurk and get a feel for everything that surrounds them.</p><p>除此之外，社区成员通常需要时间潜伏，并了解周围的一切。</p><p> There can also be so many useful bits of information shared in places that people often won&#39;t look. The comments section on Indie Hackers, for example, is full of gold. Yet so many people will never discover this.</p><p> 在人们经常看不到的地方也可能共享了很多有用的信息。例如，关于“独立黑客”的评论部分充满了金子。然而，如此多的人永远不会发现这一点。</p><p> Another example is repeat questions. When questions are being asked over and over again, that is a clear sign that we could create a resource to stop this happening, or at least respond really easily to the people that are innocently asking the question.</p><p> 另一个例子是重复问题。当一遍又一遍地提出问题时，这是一个明显的信号，表明我们可以创造一种资源来阻止这种情况的发生，或者至少可以非常轻松地对无辜提出问题的人们做出回应。</p><p> To me, it feels wasteful to not try to consider all the things that are being shared and surface them in some kind of useful way.</p><p> 对我来说，不尝试考虑所有正在共享的事物并以某种有用的方式将它们浮出水面是一种浪费。</p><p> Another powerful aspect is that community content and curation is hard and tedious. This is probably why people don&#39;t seem to tackle it well. There is something really powerful about creating content with a long term view.</p><p> 另一个强大的方面是，社区的内容和管理是艰巨而乏味的。这可能就是为什么人们似乎无法很好地解决它的原因。从长远角度来看，创建内容确实具有强大的功能。</p><p> When you build a community digital garden you are building a mini searchable powerhouse for your niche and you can become the first place that people go to search for information.</p><p> 当您建立社区数字花园时，您将为您的利基市场建立一个小型可搜索的强大平台，并且您将成为人们搜索信息的第一站。</p><p>   When I think about what is needed to maintain a community digital garden, I think of these things:</p><p>   当我想到维护社区数字花园所需的内容时，我想到了以下几点：</p><p> the need for curation: the world moves fast, there needs to be a way to constantly stay on top of what is happening in your industry</p><p>策展的需要：世界瞬息万变，需要有一种方法来不断掌握您行业中正在发生的事情</p><p> the need for expertise: we need to be constantly tapping into people and their knowledge</p><p> 对专业知识的需求：我们需要不断挖掘人员及其知识</p><p> the need for a process: just like a business, a community digital garden will die a death if there isn&#39;t some kind of process to keep it in place.</p><p> 对流程的需求：就像企业一样，如果没有某种流程可以将社区数字花园留在原地，那么它将死亡。</p><p>  Curation is a hot topic at the moment, but it is not a new thing.</p><p>  目前，策展是一个热门话题，但这并不是新事物。</p><p> The people who curate content have a process to stay on top of information that matters for them. You can take this idea to communities too. When you build a community you must stay on top of the information that matters for your community.</p><p> 策划内容的人有一个过程，可以掌握对他们重要的信息。您也可以将此想法带入社区。建立社区时，您必须紧跟对社区重要的信息。</p><p> You and your community will become irrelevant when you stop doing this. The conversations you start will become stale and boring fairly quickly.</p><p> 当您停止这样做时，您和您的社区将变得无关紧要。您开始的对话会很快变得陈旧且无聊。</p><p>  keep a close eye on what your community are talking about, inside or outside of your &#39;community garden wall&#39;</p><p>  密切关注“社区花园墙”内部或外部的社区在谈论什么</p><p>   When you know what people are talking and writing about it becomes easier to have meaningful conversations with them. This is where you can start going deeper into the things they know that align with the things you want to know.</p><p>当您知道人们在谈论和写作的内容时，与他们进行有意义的对话就变得容易了。在这里，您可以开始更深入地了解他们所知道的事物和您想知道的事物。</p><p>  this will naturally lead you to have access to so much information and the ability to share it in many different ways</p><p>  这自然会导致您可以访问大量信息并能够以多种不同方式共享信息</p><p>  Communities come in all shapes and sizes. Gathering information usefully and consistently is hard. I don&#39;t claim to be an expert in data, research, information architecture or UX design.</p><p>  社区有各种形式和规模。持续有效地收集信息非常困难。我并不声称自己是数据，研究，信息架构或UX设计方面的专家。</p><p> I am an expert in caring for the communities I create. I also love seeing how others do this, especially on a (small) indie scale.</p><p> 我是照顾我创建的社区的专家。我也很喜欢看到别人如何做到这一点，尤其是在（小型）独立规模上。</p><p> As a community builder you are well, or best placed, to be curating content because:</p><p> 作为社区建设者，您擅长或最擅长于策划内容，因为：</p><p>  The more of an expert you become in your industry the better placed you become for deciding what is interesting and useful. It is then up to you to decide how you share the information usefully with your community.</p><p>  您在行业中成为专家的越多，您在决定有趣和有用的事情上的地位就越高。然后由您决定如何与社区有效地共享信息。</p><p> I&#39;m guessing it would be nearly impossible to try to organize each and every discussion that happens within the walls of the community, let alone discussions and content that happen outside of the walls.</p><p> 我猜想几乎不可能组织在社区内进行的每一次讨论，更不用说在墙外进行的讨论和内容了。</p><p> It can quickly become overwhelming. Which is why a process is needed. Without a process, and a commitment to make that process happen, it quickly dies a death.</p><p>它会很快变得势不可挡。这就是为什么需要一个过程。如果没有流程，并且没有实现流程的承诺，它很快就会死亡。</p><p> I re-iterate, the tool is kind of irrelevant, it&#39;s the process of taking action on information and committing to organize it in a useful way.</p><p> 我重申一下，该工具是无关紧要的，它是对信息采取行动并致力于以有用的方式组织信息的过程。</p><p> I’m still exploring this and I would love to see some more concrete examples. For now, a few follow which aren’t necessarily community digital gardens, but the actions and philosophy aligns.</p><p> 我仍在对此进行探索，我希望看到一些更具体的例子。目前，有一些地方不一定是社区数字花园，但是其行动和理念是一致的。</p><p> It’s important, imho, to see how people experiment with these things on a small scale too.</p><p> 恕我直言，重要的是要看到人们也如何在小规模上尝试这些东西。</p><p>    This whole post is inspired by the Notion resource that I&#39;ve been curating for my paid newsletter subscribers.</p><p>    整篇文章的灵感源于我一直为付费新闻订阅者策划的概念资源。</p><p> I started it by collecting a few links and some tools. The amount of time I started spending on it made me realize how useful this could be for people.</p><p> 我首先收集了一些链接和一些工具。我开始花时间的时间使我意识到这对人们有多大用处。</p><p> I&#39;ve spent countless hours adding stuff in and trying to keep it organized. It will never be complete and many sections may never get off the ground.</p><p> 我花了无数小时来添加内容并试图使其井井有条。它永远不会完成，很多部分可能永远不会动手。</p><p> I imagine in time I might hire someone to help me maintain and add to this.</p><p>我想我会及时雇用某人来帮助我进行维护和补充。</p><p>   Lenny has a very successful paid newsletter and now Slack community. I love the way he approaches things.</p><p>   Lenny拥有非常成功的付费新闻通讯，现在拥有Slack社区。我喜欢他对待事物的方式。</p><p> We all know Slack doesn&#39;t keep a history of conversations. This goes against all things digital garden-esque. However, as Lenny&#39;s Slack has gotten busier he has started to experiment by choosing some of the best posts each week and highlight them in a weekly newsletter.</p><p> 我们都知道Slack没有保留对话的历史。这有悖于数字花园式的一切。但是，随着Lenny的Slack变得越来越忙碌，他开始尝试每周选择一些最佳帖子并在每周时事通讯中突出显示这些内容。</p><p> It is far from perfect, but taking things in stages and whilst also experimenting is key. To me, this is very much in line with a community digital garden in the sense that it is bringing relevant information to people in a different and longer-term way.</p><p> 它远非完美，但分阶段进行以及尝试是关键。对我而言，这非常符合社区数字花园，因为它以不同的长期方式将相关信息带给人们。</p><p>   We&#39;ve been working on making Indie Hacker groups more useful. One of the things we&#39;ve done is to create a way for people add relevant links into the sidebar.</p><p>   我们一直在努力使Indie Hacker小组更有用。我们要做的事情之一是为人们创建一种向边栏中添加相关链接的方法。</p><p> In addition to this, members can add links and discussions into specific groups in an attempt to keep things somewhat naturally organized. It’s not completely natural tbh, I end up having to move many posts to the right location. 🙄</p><p> 除此之外，成员可以将链接和讨论添加到特定的组中，以保持事物的自然组织。这并非完全自然，我最终不得不将许多帖子移到正确的位置。 🙄</p><p> We have lots of ideas to improve upon this, I&#39;m not sure how it will all end up looking as we have so many ideas. However, we are trying and making some positive steps in this direction.</p><p> 我们有很多想法可以对此进行改进，但由于我们有很多想法，我不确定最终将如何发展。但是，我们正在朝这个方向努力并采取一些积极步骤。</p><p>   At  Ministry of Testing we have years and years worth of content. This page here is an attempt to curate and surface content into categories that we feel people would find useful.</p><p>在测试部，我们拥有多年价值的内容。此页面旨在将内容整理和表述为我们认为人们会觉得有用的类别。</p><p> This was not an automated job and it required careful hand curation by the team.</p><p> 这不是自动化的工作，需要团队精心策划。</p><p>  I like how  Trends.co are pushing really valuable information. The tools they use are not modern (WordPress, Google Sheets, Facebook and email), but the way they approach things is very much on providing value with the information they create and doing their best to organize it in a good way.</p><p>  我喜欢Trends.co推动真正有价值的信息的方式。他们使用的工具不是现代工具（WordPress，Google Sheets，Facebook和电子邮件），但是他们处理事情的方式很大程度上取决于为其创建的信息提供价值并尽力以一种好的方式组织这些信息。</p><p>    I&#39;m guessing some people will debate what is defined as a community digital garden. This post is a way for me to get these ideas out into the open rather than getting too pedantic about the definition.</p><p>    我猜有些人会辩论什么是社区数字花园。这篇文章是让我公开发表这些想法的一种方法，而不是过于草率地定义。</p><p> At the end of the day, for me, community digital gardening isn&#39;t about expecting the community members to do all the work of curating. It&#39;s (usually) unreasonable to expect people to do this in today&#39;s world.</p><p> 归根结底，对我而言，社区数字园艺并不是指期望社区成员完成所有策展工作。期望人们在当今世界中做到这一点（通常）是不合理的。</p><p> It is also about giving importance to all content rather than just whatever has been most recently published. By giving importance to all content, means we will be giving importance to more community members and have an understanding that people join communities with different abilities and experiences.</p><p> 它还要重视所有内容，而不仅仅是最近发布的内容。通过重视所有内容，意味着我们将重视更多的社区成员，并了解人们加入具有不同能力和经验的社区。</p><p> There needs to be a process and a commitment from the community&#39;s leadership to recognize that curating and maintaining a resource is of value to the community.</p><p> 社区领导需要有一个过程和一项承诺，以认识到策划和维护资源对社区具有价值。</p><p> Take the lead from your community: pay attention to what people are sharing and talking about.</p><p>从您的社区带头：关注人们正在分享和谈论的内容。</p><p>   As with most things, it makes sense to start small, experiment and build upon the habits you create. Over time it will have a snowball effect.</p><p>   与大多数事情一样，从小处做起，尝试并建立您所养成的习惯是有意义的。随着时间的流逝，它将产生滚雪球效应。</p><p> I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts on this and whether you can think of other communities that align with the philosophy of community digital gardens.</p><p> 我很想听听您对此的想法，以及您是否可以想到符合社区数字花园理念的其他社区。</p><p>  Do you think a well run sub-reddit is pretty close to a community digital garden? I&#39;m thinking something like  reddit.com/r/learnprogramming .</p><p>  您是否认为运行良好的sub-reddit非常接近社区数字花园？我在想类似reddit.com/r/learnprogramming的东西。</p><p> This might be a stretch but if I consider the wiki, that&#39;s kind of like the main curated content. For the posts, they&#39;re in chronological order but if we just consider the commenting and upvoting to be a part of the process of curating, does that count?</p><p> 这可能有点费力，但是如果我考虑维基，那有点像主要策划内容。对于帖子，它们按时间顺序排列，但是如果我们仅将评论和投票视为策划过程的一部分，那算不算？</p><p> As I&#39;m writing this, I realize more that it&#39;s not really a community digital garden but might just have parallels with one haha. Hopefully, this sparks some inspiration though!</p><p> 在撰写本文时，我进一步意识到，它实际上并不是一个社区数字花园，而可能与一个哈哈类似。希望这会激发一些灵感！</p><p> Anyways, great post! I think this could be really valuable. It&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m trying to do with a newsletter idea that I&#39;m validating. The approach is: Choose a problem or question commonly shared across indie hackers, hold a handful of short interviews with other founders to see how they&#39;ve solved it, then curate with other online research and write a report. For the future reports I have in mind, it sounds like they would fit the bill of a post within a community digital garden for indie hackers.</p><p> 无论如何，很棒的帖子！我认为这可能真的很有价值。这正是我要验证的时事通讯的想法。方法是：选择独立黑客之间普遍存在的一个问题或疑问，与其他创始人进行几次简短的访谈，看看他们如何解决，然后与其他在线研究一起策划并撰写报告。对于我想到的未来报告，听起来它们很适合独立黑客在社区数字花园中的职位。</p><p> Sidenote: I&#39;m relatively new around the Indie Hackers community but your name already stands out to me. I really look up to how much value and interaction you help bring to this community!</p><p>旁注：我在Indie Hackers社区中相对较新，但是您的名字已经对我很突出。我真的很期待您能为这个社区带来多少价值和互动！</p><p>  This is awesome. I&#39;ve been working on building out the &#34;library&#34; in my membership to include evergreen helpful content from ongoing convos and around things that might come up a lot like tool and article recommendations.</p><p>  这太棒了。我一直在努力建立成员资格的“图书馆”，以包括来自不断发展的团队的常绿有用内容，以及围绕诸如工具和文章建议之类的内容。</p><p>  Thank you so much for sharing, Rosie. I have been looking around for some of the information here.</p><p>  非常感谢您的分享，Rosie。我一直在这里寻找一些信息。</p><p>  Thanks for the amazing article! Looking at implanting a really MVP version of a digital garden for  https://indiestack.co/</p><p>  感谢您的精彩文章！正在考虑为https://indiestack.co/植入一个真正的MVP版本的数字花园。</p><p>  There is a thing called &#34;No Pay Start Up&#34; I used to run the group workshops whereby a community admin takes a group of business people and has them all exchange their services with each other so that everyone in the group has access to a blog writer or access to a CTO or access to a graphic designer maybe some online workshops could be used to help everyone here on IH. I like your philosophy of community digital gardens. I&#39;m a big supporter of local community gardens in Urban Neighbourhoods but when we take the idea digital all I can think about is how some of these communities get overgrown or just don&#39;t have enough water and die out. Growing an online community to get some harvest takes so much love and care. I have to really focus on blog and article writing for my start up theirs so many features I even forget how to use them sometimes. It&#39;s like forgetting where to turn the watering system on at xp.</p><p>  我曾经举办过一个名为“无薪启动”的活动，该活动由社区管理员带领一群商人，并让他们彼此交换服务，从而使每个人都可以访问博客作者。或获得CTO或图形设计师的帮助，也许可以使用一些在线研讨会来帮助IH上的每个人。我喜欢您的社区数字花园理念。我是城市社区本地社区花园的大力支持者，但是当我们采用数字化的想法时，我所能想到的就是这些社区中的一些社区是如何过度生长或只是没有足够的水而死亡。发展在线社区以获得收获需要如此多的关爱和关怀。我必须真正专注于博客和文章写作才能启动它们的众多功能，甚至忘记了有时如何使用它们。这就像忘记在xp处打开浇水系统的位置一样。</p><p>  Would a community like ours be able to help you  @rosiesherry  https://timekeeperbank.com/a-new-way-to-build-community/ I think being able to search in a group is pretty helpful, and we also allow video uploads, but they are limited in size.</p><p>  像我们这样的社区能够为您提供帮助吗？@rosiesherry https://timekeeperbank.com/a-new-way-to-build-community/我认为可以在一个小组中进行搜索非常有帮助，我们还允许视频上载，但大小受限制。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/building-a-community-digital-garden-7e941d107c">https://www.indiehackers.com/post/building-a-community-digital-garden-7e941d107c</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/社区/">#社区</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
