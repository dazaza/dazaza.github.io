He particularly loves watercolors made by the company Holbein. “They have really nice purples that you can’t get in other paints,” he says. If Conway is after a specific shade—perhaps the dark, almost-brown color the company has labeled “Mars Violet” or the more merlot-tinted “Quinacridone Violet”—he might scroll through a Holbein chart that organizes the colors by similarity. Anyone who has considered painting a wall is familiar with these arrays: lines of color that transition from bright yellows into greens, blues, purples, and browns.</p><p>美国国立卫生研究院（National Institutes of Health）的艺术家和神经科学研究员Bevil Conway对色彩感到疯狂。他特别喜欢Holbein公司制作的水彩画。他说：“它们的紫色非常好，是其他涂料无法比拟的。”如果Conway使用了特定的阴影-也许公司将其标记为“ Mars Violet”，或者将其命名为“ Mars Violet”或“ Quinacridone Violet”。任何考虑过粉刷墙壁的人都对这些阵列很熟悉：从明亮的黄色到绿色，蓝色，紫色和棕色的颜色线条过渡。</p><p> But if Conway decides to shop around at another paint company like Pantone, that chart, also known as a “color space,” will be organized differently. And if he chooses to consult the Commission Internationale de l’Éclarage, an organization that researches and standardizes measurements of light and color, he will find yet another unique map. Conway is baffled by the choices. “Why are there so many different color spaces?” he asks. “If this is really reflective of something fundamental about how we see and perceive, then shouldn’t there be  one color space?”</p><p> 但是，如果Conway决定在Pantone等另一家涂料公司购物，该图表（也称为“色彩空间”）的组织方式将有所不同。而且，如果他选择咨询研究和标准化光色测量标准的组织国际宣言委员会（C委会），他会发现另一幅独特的地图。康韦对选择感到困惑。 “为什么会有这么多不同的色彩空间？”他问。 “如果这确实反映了我们如何看待和感知的基本知识，那么不应该有一个色彩空间吗？”</p><p> How humans perceive color, and how all those shades are related, is a question scientists and philosophers have been attempting to answer for millennia. The ancient Greeks, who famously had no word for the color blue, argued over whether colors were composed of red, black, white, and light (that was Plato’s theory), or whether color was celestial light sent down from the heavens by the gods and that each color was a mixture of white and black or lightness and darkness (that was Aristotle’s). Isaac Newton’s experiments with prisms identified the components of the rainbow and led him to theorize that the three primary colors, from which all other colors are made, are red, yellow, and blue.</p><p> 人们如何看待颜色以及所有这些阴影之间的关系，是科学家和哲学家数年来一直试图回答的问题。著名的古希腊人没有用过蓝色的说法，他们争论着颜色是否由红色，黑色，白色和光组成（这是柏拉图的理论），或者颜色是否是诸神从天上降下来的天体光并且每种颜色都是白色和黑色或明暗的混合色（那是亚里士多德的）。艾萨克·牛顿（Isaac Newton）进行的棱镜实验确定了彩虹的成分，并促使他推论得出构成所有其他颜色的三种原色分别是红色，黄色和蓝色。</p><p>  Today, our scientific understanding of color perception is rooted in biology. Each color represents a specific part of the electromagnetic spectrum, though humans can only see the slice of this spectrum known as “visible light.” Of the wavelengths visible to humans, red ones are longer, while blues and violets are shorter. Photons of light stimulate photoreceptors in the eye, which transform that information into electrical signals that are sent to the retina, which processes those signals and sends them along to the brain’s visual cortex. But the mechanics of how the eye and nervous system interact with those light waves, and how a person subjectively perceives color, are two very different things.</p><p>  今天，我们对色彩感知的科学理解已根植于生物学。每种颜色代表电磁光谱的特定部分，尽管人类只能看到该光谱的一部分，即“可见光”。在人类可见的波长中，红色的波长较长，而蓝色和紫色的波长较短。光子会刺激眼睛中的感光器，这些感光器将信息转换为电信号，然后将其发送到视网膜，然后再处理这些信号并将其发送到大脑的视觉皮层。但是，眼睛和神经系统如何与这些光波相互作用以及人如何主观感知颜色的机制是两件截然不同的事情。</p><p>  “One way to think about neuroscience is that it’s a study of signal transformations,” writes Soumya Chatterjee, a senior scientist at the Allen Institute for Brain Science who studies the neurology of color perception, in an email to WIRED. He says that once the photoreceptors in the retina have passed information to the visual cortex, the information continues to be transformed—and scientists don’t yet understand how those series of transformations give rise to perception, or the experience an individual person has of color.</p><p>  艾伦脑科学研究所的高级科学家Soumya Chatterjee写道：“思考神经科学的一种方法是，它是对信号转换的研究。”他说，一旦视网膜中的光感受器将信息传递到视觉皮层，信息就将继续被转化-科学家们还不了解这些系列的转化如何引起感知或个人的色彩体验。</p><p>  Some aspects of color can already be measured precisely. Scientists can calculate the wavelength of the light and the luminance, or brightness, of a color. But once you bring human perception into the mix, things get a little more complicated. People perceive color by factoring in a number of other variables, like the quality of the light or the other tones bordering the color. Sometimes that means the brain will perceive the same object as two completely different colors; that happened with  the famous dress, which in some lights looked white and gold and in others looked blue and black.</p><p>  颜色的某些方面已经可以精确测量。科学家可以计算光的波长和颜色的亮度或亮度。但是，一旦将人的感知带入混合，事情就会变得更加复杂。人们会通过考虑许多其他变量来感知颜色，例如光线的质量或与颜色接壤的其他色调。有时，这意味着大脑会将同一物体感知为两种完全不同的颜色。著名的连衣裙就发生了这种情况，在某些灯光下，灯光看起来是白色和金色，在其他灯光下看起来是蓝色和黑色。</p><p>  And sometimes those brain calculations mean that two completely different inputs can elicit the same perception. Yellow light, for example, has its own specific wavelength that the brain understands as yellow. But mix a green and a red light—each of which have their own unique wavelengths—and the brain will also understand that combination to be yellow, too, even though that light’s physical properties are different from the other wavelengths we perceive to be yellow. Figuring out why our brains interpret those two different inputs as similar has been hard to puzzle out.</p><p>  有时那些大脑的计算意味着两个完全不同的输入可以引起相同的感知。例如，黄光具有自己特定的波长，大脑将其理解为黄光。但是，将绿色和红色的光混合在一起（每种都有各自独特的波长），即使光的物理性质不同于我们认为是黄色的其他波长，大脑也将理解该组合也是黄色的。弄清楚为什么我们的大脑会把这两个不同的输入解释为相似的输入，很难让人感到困惑。</p><p> Now, Conway is suggesting a new method of organizing and understanding colors: by basing it on patterns of neuron activation in the brain. In  a recent paper published in  Current Biology, Conway was able to show that each color elicits a unique pattern of neural activity. In this study, he focused first on the brain’s response to a color, rather than on the color each of his study subjects verbally described. This approach reframes how neuroscientists typically try to answer questions about color perception. “Perception is usually taken as the known quantity, and then researchers tried to figure out the neuronal processes leading to that,” writes Chatterjee. “Here, the perceptual variable is taken as the unknown (this abstract color space), and they try to derive it based on the measured neuronal activity.”</p><p>现在，Conway正在提出一种组织和理解颜色的新方法：通过将其建立在大脑神经元激活模式的基础上。在最近发表于《当代生物学》上的一篇论文中，康威能够证明每种颜色都引发了独特的神经活动模式。在这项研究中，他首先专注于大脑对颜色的反应，而不是针对每个研究对象口头描述的颜色。这种方法改变了神经科学家通常如何尝试回答有关颜色感知的问题。查特吉写道：“通常将知觉视为已知量，然后研究人员试图找出导致这种情况的神经元过程。” “在这里，感知变量被当作未知变量（这个抽象色彩空间），他们试图根据测得的神经元活动来导出它。”</p><p> Conway is certainly not the first to use technology to track the brain’s response to color. Previous studies have used fMRI data to capture what’s going on as a person looks at different colors—but those scans lag, so it’s hard to tell exactly what’s happening in the brain at the moment it’s interpreting those stimuli. And fMRI scans are an indirect way to track brain activity, since they measure blood flow, not actual neuron firing.</p><p> 康威当然不是第一个使用技术来跟踪大脑对颜色的反应的人。先前的研究使用fMRI数据来捕获人看着不同颜色时发生的事情，但是这些扫描会滞后，因此很难准确地解释大脑在解释这些刺激时正在发生什么。 fMRI扫描是一种间接的追踪大脑活动的方法，因为它们可以测量血流量，而不是实际的神经元放电。</p><p> So Conway tried another method called magnetoencephalography (MEG), which uses magnetic sensors to detect the electrical activity of neurons firing. The technique is much faster than fMRI, so Conway could capture patterns of neuron firing before, during, and after his subjects looked at different colors. He had 18 volunteers take turns sitting in the MEG machine, which looks kind of like a giant retro hair dryer at a beauty salon, and showed them cards, each with a spiral that was either yellow, brown, pink, purple, green, dark green, blue, or dark blue. Then, during the MEG scan, he asked the subjects to name which color they saw.</p><p> 因此，康威（Conway）尝试了另一种称为脑磁图（MEG）的方法，该方法使用磁传感器检测神经元放电的电活动。该技术比fMRI快得多，因此Conway可以捕获在他的受试者观察不同颜色之前，之中和之后的神经元放电模式。他有18位志愿者轮流坐在MEG机器上，看起来像是一家美容院的巨型复古吹风机，并向他们展示了卡片，每张卡片的螺旋形状均为黄色，棕色，粉红色，紫色，绿色，深色绿色，蓝色或深蓝色。然后，在进行MEG扫描时，他要求受试者说出所看到的颜色。</p><p> Greg Horwitz, associate professor of physiology and biophysics at the University of Washington, says Conway was very clever about how he designed the study. Instead of using colors that we perceive as being similar, this study used colors that evoke similar reactions from the photoreceptors in the eye. For example, yellow and brown look very different to us, but they actually elicit similar responses among photoreceptors. That means that any differences in the patterns of brain activity detected by the MEG should be attributed not to the interaction between the light and the receptors in the eye, but to processing in the brain’s visual cortex. Horwitz says this shows just how complex perception is: “More complicated than photoreceptors.”</p><p> 华盛顿大学生理学和生物物理学副教授格雷格·霍维茨（Greg Horwitz）说，康威（Conway）对他如何设计这项研究非常聪明。这项研究没有使用我们认为相似的颜色，而是使用了引起眼睛感光细胞相似反应的颜色。例如，黄色和棕色对我们来说看起来很不一样，但实际上它们在感光体之间引起了相似的反应。这意味着，MEG检测到的大脑活动方式的任何差异都不应归因于光与眼睛中的受体之间的相互作用，而应归因于大脑视觉皮层的加工。霍维茨说，这表明了感知的复杂性：“比感光器更复杂。”</p><p> Conway next trained an artificial intelligence classifier to read the MEG results and look for similar patterns of neural activity among the 18 subjects. Then, he wanted to see if those patterns matched up with the colors the subjects reported seeing. For example, did a specific pattern of neural activity always correlate with the person saying they’d seen a dark blue spiral? “If the information can be decoded, then presumably that information is available to the rest of the brain to inform behavior,” he says.</p><p> 康威接下来训练了一个人工智能分类器，以读取MEG结果并寻找18名受试者中类似的神经活动模式。然后，他想看看这些图案是否与受试者报告看到的颜色相匹配。例如，特定的神经活动模式是否总是与说自己看到深蓝色螺旋的人相关？他说：“如果信息能够被解码，那么大概是大脑的其余部分可以利用这些信息来告知行为。”</p><p>  At first, Conway was pretty skeptical that he would get any results. “The word on the street is that MEG has very crappy spatial resolution,” he says. Essentially, the machine is good at detecting  when there’s brain activity, but not so great at showing you  where in the brain that activity is. But as it turned out, the patterns were there and they were easy for the decoder to spot. “Lo and behold, the pattern is different enough for the different colors that I can decode with upwards of 90 percent accuracy what color you were seeing,” he says. “That’s like:  holy crap!”</p><p>  起初，康威非常怀疑他是否会取得任何结果。他说：“大街上的话是MEG具有非常糟糕的空间分辨率，”从本质上讲，该机器擅长检测何时有大脑活动，但不能很好地向您展示大脑在哪里活动。但事实证明，模式在那里，解码器很容易发现它们。他说：“瞧，对于不同的颜色，图案就足够不同了，我可以以90％的精度将您所看到的颜色解码。” “这就像：天哪！”</p><p>  Chatterjee says that Conway’s MEG approach allows neuroscientists to flip traditional questions of perception upside down. “Perception is usually taken as the known quantity”—in this case, the color of the spiral—“and then researchers tried to figure out the neuronal processes leading to that,” he writes. But in this experiment, Conway approached the question from the opposite side: He measured the neuronal processes and then made conclusions about how those processes affect his subjects’ color perception.</p><p>  查特吉说，康威的MEG方法使神经科学家可以颠覆传统的感知问题。他写道：“通常将知觉视为已知量”，在这种情况下，就是螺旋的颜色。然后，研究人员试图找出导致这种情况的神经元过程。但是在这个实验中，康威从相反的角度解决了这个问题：他测量了神经元过程，然后就这些过程如何影响受试者的色彩感知做出了结论。</p><p> The MEG also allowed Conway to watch perception unfold over time. In this experiment, it took about one second from the moment the volunteer saw the spiral until the moment when they named its color aloud. The machine was able to reveal activation patterns during that period, showing when color perception arose in the brain, and then track that activation for approximately another half second as the percept shifted to a semantic concept—the word the volunteer could use to name the color.</p><p>MEG还允许Conway观察随着时间的推移感知的发展。在此实验中，从志愿者看到螺旋的那一刻到他们大声命名其颜色的那一刻之间，大约花费了一秒钟。该机器能够揭示该期间的激活模式，显示何时在大脑中出现颜色感知，然后随着感知转变为语义概念（志愿者可以使用该词来命名颜色）来跟踪该激活大约半秒。 。</p><p> But there are some limitations to this approach. While Conway could identify that viewing different colors creates different patterns of brain responses, and that his 18 subjects experienced specific patterns for colors like yellow, brown, or light blue, he can’t say exactly where in the brain those patterns emerge. The paper also doesn’t discuss any of the mechanisms that create these patterns. But, Conway says, figuring out that there is a neural difference in the first place is huge. “That there is a difference is instructive, because it tells us that there is some kind of topographic map of color in the human brain,” he says.</p><p> 但是这种方法有一些局限性。康威（Conway）可以识别出观察不同的颜色会产生不同的大脑反应模式，并且他的18位受试者经历了黄色，棕色或浅蓝色等特定颜色的模式，但他无法确切地说出这些模式在大脑中的何处出现。本文也没有讨论创建这些模式的任何机制。但是，康威说，首先要弄清楚存在神经差异是巨大的。他说：“差异是有启发性的，因为它告诉我们人脑中存在某种颜色的地形图。”</p><p> “It’s that  relationships between colors as we perceive them (perceptual color space) can be derived from the  relationships of recorded activity (even if it’s MEG and can’t get you down to the level of single neurons or small ensembles of neurons),” writes Chatterjee. “That makes this a creative and interesting study.”</p><p> “这是因为我们感知到的颜色之间的关系（感知的颜色空间）可以从记录的活动的关系中得出（即使是MEG并不能使您陷入单个神经元或神经元小团的水平），”查特吉写道。 “这使这项研究富有创造力且有趣。”</p><p> Plus, Conway says, this research refutes all those arguments that MEG isn’t precise enough to capture these patterns. “Now we can use [MEG] to decode all sorts of things related to the very fine spatial structure of neurons in the brain,” Conway suggests.</p><p> 另外，康威说，这项研究驳斥了所有这些论点，即MEG不够精确，无法捕获这些模式。 “现在我们可以使用[MEG]来解码与大脑中神经元的非常精细的空间结构有关的各种事物，”康威建议。</p><p> The MEG data also showed that the brain processed those eight color spirals differently depending on whether they showed warm or dark colors. Conway made sure to include pairs that were the same hue, meaning their wavelengths would be perceived as the same color by the eye’s photoceptors, but had different luminance, or brightness, levels, which changes how people perceive them. For example, yellow and brown are the same hue but differ in luminance. Both are warm colors. And, for cool colors, the blue and dark blue he picked were also the same hue as each other, and had the same difference in luminance as did the yellow/brown pair of warm tones.</p><p> MEG数据还显示，大脑根据显示的是暖色还是深色来不同地处理了这八个颜色螺旋。康威（Conway）确保包含相同色调的对，这意味着它们的波长会被眼睛的感光器感知为相同的颜色，但是具有不同的亮度或亮度级别，这会改变人们的感知方式。例如，黄色和棕色是相同的色调，但亮度不同。两者都是暖色。而且，对于冷色，他挑选的蓝色和深蓝色也具有相同的色相，并且与黄色/棕色的暖色调具有相同的亮度差异。</p><p> The MEG data showed that the patterns of brain activity corresponding to blue and dark blue were more similar to each other than the patterns for yellow and brown were to each other. Even though these hues all differed by the same amount of luminance, the brain processed the pair of warm colors as being much more different from one another, compared to the two blues.</p><p> MEG数据显示，与黄色和棕色对应的大脑活动模式相比，蓝色和深蓝色对应的大脑活动模式更为相似。即使这些色调在相同的亮度量上有所不同，但与两种蓝色相比，大脑对这两种暖色的处理却相差很多。</p><p>  Conway is excited to start testing more colors and to build his own color space, categorizing the relationship between them not based on wavelength but on neural activity pattern—a concept he describes as “the brain’s Pantone.” But he isn’t entirely sure where all of this research will lead. He points out that tools like lasers, which started out as a curiosity, ended up having a multitude of applications that researchers never imagined when they started playing around with them. “What we know, historically, is that when most things that turn out to be useful, their usefulness is only apparent in retrospect,” says Conway.</p><p>  康威很高兴开始测试更多的色彩并建立自己的色彩空间，将它们之间的关系不基于波长进行分类，而是基于神经活动模式进行分类，他将这一概念描述为“大脑的Pantone”。但是他不确定所有这些研究将在哪里进行。他指出，诸如激光之类的工具起初是出于好奇，最终却具有许多应用程序，而研究人员在开始使用它们时却从未想象过。康威说：“从历史上看，我们知道，当大多数事情都变得有用时，它们的有用性只有在回顾时才显现出来。”</p><p>  While Conway’s study stopped short of being able to explain exactly where the neural patterns that code for the perception of specific colors arises, researchers believe it would be possible one day. Understanding these patterns could potentially help scientists develop visual prostheses that would restore peoples’ experience of sight, or create ways for people to communicate exactly what they perceive. Or maybe this could help teach machines how to see better and in full color, like humans do.</p><p>康威（Conway）的研究未能完全解释编码特定颜色的神经模式出现在何处，但研究人员认为这一天是有可能的。了解这些模式可能会帮助科学家开发视觉假体，以恢复人们的视觉体验，或为人们提供准确传达他们所感知的方式。也许这可以帮助教会机器如何像人类一样更好地观看全彩色。</p><p> And on a more fundamental level, figuring out how color perception matches with neural activity is an important step toward understanding how the brain constructs our understanding of the world around us. “If you could find a brain area where the representation matched perception, that would be a huge leap,” says Horwitz. “Finding the part of the brain where the representation of color matches what we experience would be a big step towards understanding what color perception really is.”</p><p> 从更基本的层面上讲，弄清楚颜色感知与神经活动之间的关系是迈向了解大脑如何构建对周围世界的理解的重要一步。霍维茨说：“如果您能找到一个与表征相匹配的大脑区域，那将是一个巨大的飞跃。” “找到大脑中颜色表示与我们所经历的匹配的部分，将是理解真正的颜色感知的重要一步。”</p><p>   🏃🏽‍♀️ Want the best tools to get healthy?
