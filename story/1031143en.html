The document charged six hackers working for Russia&#39;s GRU military intelligence agency with computer crimes related to half a decade of cyberattacks across the globe, from  sabotaging the 2018 Winter Olympics in Korea to unleashing the  most destructive malware in history in Ukraine. Among those acts of cyberwar was an  unprecedented attack on Ukraine&#39;s power grid in 2016, one that appeared designed to not merely cause a blackout, but to  inflict physical damage on electric equipment. And when one cybersecurity researcher named Mike Assante dug into the details of that attack, he recognized a grid-hacking idea invented not by Russian hackers, but by the United State government, and tested a decade earlier.</p><p>本周早些时候，美国司法部公布了一份针对一群名为沙虫的黑客的起诉书。这份文件指控为俄罗斯GRU军事情报机构工作的6名黑客犯有与全球各地长达5年的网络攻击有关的计算机犯罪，从破坏2018年韩国冬奥会到在乌克兰发布史上最具破坏性的恶意软件。在这些网络战争行为中，包括2016年对乌克兰电网的前所未有的攻击，这似乎不仅是为了造成停电，而且是为了对电气设备造成物理损害。当一位名叫迈克·阿桑特(Mike Assante)的网络安全研究人员深入研究那次攻击的细节时，他认识到一个网格黑客的想法不是由俄罗斯黑客发明的，而是由美国政府发明的，并在10年前进行了测试。</p><p> The following excerpt from the book   SANDWORM: A New Era of Cyberwar and the Hunt for the Kremlin&#39;s Most Dangerous Hackers, published in paperback this week, tells the story of that early, seminal grid-hacking experiment. The demonstration was led by Assante, the late, legendary industrial control systems security pioneer. It would come to be known as the Aurora Generator Test. Today, it still serves as a powerful warning of the potential physical-world effects of cyberattacks—and an eery premonition of Sandworm&#39;s attacks to come.</p><p>以下摘录自本周出版的平装本“沙虫：网络战争的新时代和追捕克里姆林宫最危险的黑客”一书，讲述了那次具有开创性意义的早期网络黑客实验的故事。示威活动由已故的传奇工业控制系统安全先驱阿桑特领导。它后来被称为“极光发生器测试”(Aurora Generator Test)。今天，它仍然是网络攻击对现实世界潜在影响的有力警告，也是沙虫即将发动攻击的可怕预兆。</p><p> On a piercingly cold and windy morning in March 2007, Mike Assante arrived at an Idaho National Laboratory facility 32 miles west of Idaho Falls, a building in the middle of a vast, high desert landscape covered with snow and sagebrush. He walked into an auditorium inside the visitors’ center, where a small crowd was gathering. The group included officials from the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Energy, and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), executives from a handful of electric utilities across the country, and other researchers and engineers who, like Assante, were tasked by the national lab to spend their days imagining catastrophic threats to American critical infrastructure.</p><p>2007年3月的一个寒风刺骨的早晨，迈克·阿桑特(Mike Assante)来到爱达荷州瀑布以西32英里(约合32公里)处的爱达荷州国家实验室(Idaho National Laboratory)，这座建筑位于覆盖着积雪和山艾树的广阔高地沙漠景观的中间。他走进游客中心内的一个礼堂，那里聚集着一小群人。该小组包括国土安全部(Department Of Homeland Security)、能源部(Department Of Energy)和北美电力可靠性公司(North American Electric Reliability Corporation，NERC)的官员，来自全国各地几家电力公用事业公司的高管，以及其他研究人员和工程师，他们和阿桑特一样，受命于国家实验室，整天想象美国关键基础设施面临的灾难性威胁。</p><p> If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

The screens showed live footage from several angles of a massive diesel generator. The machine was the size of a school bus, a mint green, gargantuan mass of steel weighing 27 tons, about as much as an M3 Bradley tank. It sat a mile away from its audience in an electrical substation, producing enough electricity to power a hospital or a navy ship and emitting a steady roar. Waves of heat coming off its surface rippled the horizon in the video feed’s image.</p><p>在房间的前面是一组视频监视器和数据馈送，它们被设置成面向房间的体育场座位，就像火箭发射时的任务控制中心一样。屏幕上显示了一台大型柴油发电机从多个角度的实况画面。这台机器有校车大小，是一块薄荷绿色的巨型钢材，重达27吨，大约相当于一辆M3布拉德利坦克。它坐在离观众一英里远的变电站里，产生的电力足以为一家医院或一艘海军舰艇供电，并发出稳定的咆哮。从其表面冒出的热浪在视频馈送的图像中掀起了地平线的涟漪。</p><p>  Assante and his fellow INL researchers had bought the generator for $300,000 from an oil field in Alaska. They’d shipped it thousands of miles to the Idaho test site, an 890-square-mile piece of land where the national lab maintained a sizable power grid for testing purposes, complete with 61 miles of transmission lines and seven electrical substations.</p><p>Assante和他的INL研究人员同事花了30万美元从阿拉斯加的一个油田购买了这台发电机。他们将其运送到数千英里外的爱达荷州试验场，这是一块890平方英里的土地，国家实验室在那里维护着一个相当大的电网用于测试，包括61英里长的传输线和7个变电站。</p><p>  Now, if Assante had done his job properly, they were going to destroy it. And the assembled researchers planned to kill that very expensive and resilient piece of machinery not with any physical tool or weapon but with about 140 kilobytes of data, a file smaller than the average cat GIF shared today on Twitter.</p><p>现在，如果阿桑特做好了他的工作，他们就会毁了它。聚集在一起的研究人员计划杀死这台非常昂贵和有弹性的机器，不是用任何物理工具或武器，而是用大约140千字节的数据，这个文件比今天推特上分享的平均猫GIF小。</p><p>  Three years earlier, Assante had been the chief security officer at American Electric Power, a utility with millions of customers in 11 states from Texas to Kentucky. A former navy officer turned cybersecurity engineer, Assante had long been keenly aware of the potential for hackers to attack the power grid. But he was dismayed to see that most of his peers in the electric utility industry had a relatively simplistic view of that still-theoretical and distant threat. If hackers did somehow get deep enough into a utility’s network to start opening circuit breakers, the industry’s common wisdom at the time was that staff could simply kick the intruders out of the network and flip the power back on. “We could manage it like a storm,” Assante remembers his colleagues saying. “The way it was imagined, it would be like an outage and we’d recover from the outage, and that was the limit of thinking around the risk model.”</p><p>三年前，阿桑特曾担任美国电力公司(American Electric Power)的首席安全官，该公司是一家公用事业公司，在从德克萨斯州到肯塔基州的11个州拥有数百万客户。阿桑特曾是一名海军军官，后来成为网络安全工程师，他长期以来一直敏锐地意识到黑客攻击电网的可能性。但令他沮丧的是，他看到电力公用事业行业的大多数同行对这个仍然停留在理论上的遥远威胁持相对简单化的看法。如果黑客确实以某种方式深入到公用事业公司的网络中，开始打开断路器，当时该行业的普遍看法是，员工可以简单地将入侵者踢出网络，然后重新启动电源。“我们可以像风暴一样管理它，”Assante记得他的同事们说过。“就像想象的那样，这就像是停电，我们会从停电中恢复过来，而这就是围绕风险模型思考的极限。”</p><p>  But Assante, who had a rare level of crossover expertise between the architecture of power grids and computer security, was nagged by a more devious thought. What if attackers didn’t merely hijack the control systems of grid operators to flip switches and cause short-term blackouts, but instead reprogrammed the automated elements of the grid, components that made their own decisions about grid operations without checking with any human?</p><p>但是Assante在电网架构和计算机安全之间拥有罕见的交叉专业知识，他被一个更狡猾的想法所困扰。如果攻击者不只是劫持电网操作员的控制系统来翻转开关并造成短期停电，而是对电网的自动化元件进行重新编程，这些元件自己做出电网操作的决定，而不需要与任何人核实，会发生什么？</p><p>  In particular, Assante had been thinking about a piece of equipment called a protective relay. Protective relays are designed to function as a safety mechanism to guard against dangerous physical conditions in electric systems. If lines overheat or a generator goes out of sync, it’s those protective relays that detect the anomaly and open a circuit breaker, disconnecting the trouble spot, saving precious hardware, even preventing fires. A protective relay functions as a kind of lifeguard for the grid.</p><p>特别值得一提的是，阿桑特一直在考虑一种名为保护继电器的设备。保护继电器的设计目的是作为一种安全机制来防范电力系统中的危险物理条件。如果线路过热或发电机不同步，这些保护继电器会检测到异常并打开断路器，断开故障点，节省宝贵的硬件，甚至防止火灾。保护继电器起到电网救生员的作用。</p><p> But what if that protective relay could be paralyzed—or worse, corrupted so that it became the vehicle for an attacker’s payload?</p><p>但是，如果保护继电器可能瘫痪--或者更糟糕的是，损坏了，以至于它成为攻击者有效载荷的载体，那会怎么样呢？</p><p> That disturbing question was one Assante had carried over to Idaho National Laboratory from his time at the electric utility. Now, in the visitor center of the lab’s test range, he and his fellow engineers were about to put his most malicious idea into practice. The secret experiment was given a code name that would come to be synonymous with the potential for digital attacks to inflict physical consequences: Aurora.</p><p>这个令人不安的问题是阿桑特在电力公司工作期间带到爱达荷州国家实验室的一个问题。现在，在实验室测试靶场的游客中心，他和他的工程师同事们即将把他最恶毒的想法付诸实践。这项秘密实验被赋予了一个代号，这个代号将成为数字攻击造成物理后果的可能性的同义词：奥罗拉(Aurora)。</p><p> The test director read out the time: 11:33 a.m. He checked with a safety engineer that the area around the lab’s diesel generator was clear of bystanders. Then he sent a go-ahead to one of the cybersecurity researchers at the national lab’s office in Idaho Falls to begin the attack. Like any real digital sabotage, this one would be performed from miles away, over the internet. The test’s simulated hacker responded by pushing roughly thirty lines of code from his machine to the protective relay connected to the bus-sized diesel generator.</p><p>考试主任宣读了时间：上午11点33分。他与一名安全工程师核实，实验室柴油发电机周围的区域没有旁观者。然后，他向爱达荷州瀑布国家实验室办公室的一名网络安全研究人员发出许可，开始攻击。就像任何真正的数字破坏一样，这一次将在几英里外通过互联网进行。测试的模拟黑客的回应是将大约30行代码从他的机器推送到连接到总线大小的柴油发电机的保护继电器上。</p><p> The inside of that generator, until that exact moment of its sabotage, had been performing a kind of invisible, perfectly harmonized dance with the electric grid to which it was connected. Diesel fuel in its chambers was aerosolized and detonated with inhuman timing to move pistons that rotated a steel rod inside the generator’s engine—the full assembly was known as the “prime mover”—roughly 600 times a minute. That rotation was carried through a rubber grommet, designed to reduce any vibration, and then into the electricity-generating components: a rod with arms wrapped in copper wiring, housed between two massive magnets so that each rotation induced electrical current in the wires. Spin that mass of wound copper fast enough, and it produced 60 hertz of alternating current, feeding its power into the vastly larger grid to which it was connected.</p><p>发电机的内部，直到它被破坏的那一刻，一直在与它所连接的电网进行一种看不见的、完美协调的舞蹈。燃烧室中的柴油被雾化并以非人道的时机引爆，以移动活塞，这些活塞旋转发电机引擎内的钢棒-整个组装被称为“原动机”-大约每分钟600次。这种旋转是通过一个旨在减少任何振动的橡胶环进行的，然后进入发电部件：一个带有铜线包裹着手臂的杆子，安装在两个巨大的磁铁之间，这样每一次旋转都会在导线中感应电流。以足够快的速度旋转缠绕的铜，它产生60赫兹的交流电，将其电力输送到它所连接的大得多的电网中。</p><p>  A protective relay attached to that generator was designed to prevent it from connecting to the rest of the power system without first syncing to that exact rhythm: 60 hertz. But Assante’s hacker in Idaho Falls had just reprogrammed that safeguard device, flipping its logic on its head.</p><p>安装在发电机上的保护继电器的设计是为了防止它连接到电力系统的其余部分，而不是首先按照准确的节奏同步：60赫兹。但是阿桑特在爱达荷州瀑布的黑客刚刚重新编程了那个安全装置，颠覆了它的逻辑。</p><p>  At 11:33 a.m. and 23 seconds, the protective relay observed that the generator was perfectly synced. But then its corrupted brain did the opposite of what it was meant to do: It opened a circuit breaker to disconnect the machine.</p><p>上午11：33。23秒后，保护继电器观察到发电机完全同步。但后来它腐烂的大脑做了与它想要做的相反的事情：它打开了一个断路器来切断机器的连接。</p><p> When the generator was detached from the larger circuit of Idaho National Laboratory’s electrical grid and relieved of the burden of sharing its energy with that vast system, it instantly began to accelerate, spinning faster, like a pack of horses that had been let loose from its carriage. As soon as the protective relay observed that the generator’s rotation had sped up to be fully out of sync with the rest of the grid, its maliciously flipped logic immediately reconnected it to the grid’s machinery.</p><p>当发电机从爱达荷州国家实验室较大的电网中分离出来，摆脱了与这个庞大系统分享能量的负担时，它立即开始加速，旋转得更快，就像一群从马车上放出来的马。一旦保护继电器发现发电机的旋转速度已经加快，与电网的其余部分完全不同步，其恶意反转的逻辑立即将其重新连接到电网的机械上。</p><p> The moment the diesel generator was again linked to the larger system, it was hit with the wrenching force of every other rotating generator on the grid. All of that equipment pulled the relatively small mass of the diesel generator’s own spinning components back to its original, slower speed to match its neighbors’ frequencies.</p><p>当柴油发电机再次连接到更大的系统时，它就受到电网上所有其他旋转发电机的扭转力的打击。所有这些设备都将柴油发电机自身的旋转部件的相对较小的质量拉回原来的较低速度，以与邻居的频率相匹配。</p><p>  On the visitor center’s screens, the assembled audience watched the giant machine shake with sudden, terrible violence, emitting a sound like a deep crack of a whip. The entire process from the moment the malicious code had been triggered to that first shudder had spanned only a fraction of a second.</p><p>在游客中心的屏幕上，聚集的观众看到这台巨型机器突然可怕地摇晃着，发出像鞭子深深劈啪作响的声音。从恶意代码被触发到第一次颤抖的整个过程只持续了几分之一秒。</p><p> Black chunks began to fly out of an access panel on the generator, which the researchers had left open to watch its internals. Inside, the black rubber grommet that linked the two halves of the generator’s shaft was tearing itself apart.</p><p>黑色的大块开始从发电机上的检修板上飞出来，研究人员已经让它敞开着，以便观察它的内部结构。在内部，连接发电机轴两半的黑色橡胶扣环正在自行撕裂。</p><p> A few seconds later, the machine shook again as the protective relay code repeated its sabotage cycle, disconnecting the machine and reconnecting it out of sync. This time a cloud of gray smoke began to spill out of the generator, perhaps the result of the rubber debris burning inside it.</p><p>几秒钟后，随着保护继电器代码重复其破坏周期，机器再次抖动，断开机器连接，并重新连接不同步。这一次，一团灰色的烟雾开始从发电机中喷出，可能是内部燃烧的橡胶碎片造成的。</p><p> Assante, despite the months of effort and millions of dollars in federal funds he’d spent developing the attack they were witnessing, somehow felt a kind of sympathy for the machine as it was being torn apart from within. “You find yourself rooting for it, like the little engine that could,” Assante remembered. “I was thinking, ‘You can make it!’ ”</p><p>尽管阿桑特花费了数月的努力和数百万美元的联邦资金来开发他们目睹的攻击，但不知何故，当这台机器从内部被撕裂时，他对它感到了一种同情。阿桑特回忆道：“你会发现自己在为它加油，就像那台可以做到的小引擎。”“我在想，‘你能做到的！’”</p><p>  The machine did not make it. After a third hit, it released a larger cloud of gray smoke. “That prime mover is toast,” an engineer standing next to Assante said. After a fourth blow, a plume of black smoke rose from the machine thirty feet into the air in a final death rattle.</p><p>这台机器没有成功。在第三次袭击之后，它释放出更大的灰色烟雾云。站在阿桑特旁边的一名工程师说：“这个原动力已经完蛋了。”在第四次打击后，一缕黑烟从机器上升起30英尺高，发出最后的死亡嘎嘎声。</p><p> Sign up for our  Longreads newsletter for the best features, ideas, and investigations from WIRED.</p><p>注册我们的Longreads时事通讯，从“连线”获得最好的功能、想法和调查。</p><p> The test director ended the experiment and disconnected the ruined generator from the grid one final time, leaving it deathly still. In the forensic analysis that followed, the lab’s researchers would find that the engine shaft had collided with the engine’s internal wall, leaving deep gouges in both and filling the inside of the machine with metal shavings. On the other side of the generator, its wiring and insulation had melted and burned. The machine was totaled.</p><p>测试主管结束了实验，最后一次切断了损坏的发电机与电网的连接，让它一动不动。在随后的法医分析中，实验室的研究人员发现，引擎轴与发动机内壁相撞，在两边都留下了很深的凹痕，并在机器的内部填满了金属屑。在发电机的另一边，它的线路和绝缘已经熔化和烧毁。这台机器已经报废了。</p><p>  In the wake of the demonstration, a silence fell over the visitor center. “It was a sober moment,” Assante remembers. The engineers had just proven without a doubt that hackers who attacked an electric utility could go beyond a temporary disruption of the victim’s operations: They could damage its most critical equipment beyond repair. “It was so vivid. You could imagine it happening to a machine in an actual plant, and it would be terrible,” Assante says. “The implication was that with just a few lines of code, you can create conditions that were physically going to be very damaging to the machines we rely on.”</p><p>示威结束后，游客中心陷入一片寂静。“那是一个清醒的时刻，”阿桑特回忆道。工程师们刚刚毫无疑问地证明，攻击一家电力公司的黑客可能不仅仅是暂时中断受害者的运营：他们可能会损坏最关键的设备，使其无法修复。“太生动了。你可以想象这种情况会发生在实际工厂的一台机器上，那将是可怕的。“阿桑特说。“言下之意是，只需几行代码，就可以创造出对我们所依赖的机器造成严重物理破坏的条件。”</p><p> But Assante also remembers feeling something weightier in the moments after the Aurora experiment. It was a sense that, like Robert Oppenheimer watching the first atomic bomb test at another U.S. national lab six decades earlier, he was witnessing the birth of some- thing historic and immensely powerful.</p><p>但阿桑特也记得，在奥罗拉实验之后的片刻，感觉到了更重的东西。这是一种感觉，就像60年前罗伯特·奥本海默(Robert Oppenheimer)在另一个美国国家实验室观看第一次原子弹试验一样，他见证了一些历史性和巨大威力的东西的诞生。</p><p> “I had a very real pit in my stomach,” Assante says. “It was like a glimpse of the future.”</p><p>“我的胃里真的有一个坑，”阿桑特说。“这就像是对未来的一瞥。”</p><p>  From the book   SANDWORM: A New Era of Cyberwar and the Hunt for the Kremlin&#39;s Most Dangerous Hackers.
