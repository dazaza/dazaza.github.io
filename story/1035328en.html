Enough to cover a year of expenses and a bit more. I stopped spending money on almost everything.</p><p>我有大约12000美元的积蓄。足够支付一年的开支，甚至更多。我几乎什么都不花钱了。</p><p> How hard could that be, right? I create something, find 10-20 clients, and done. I&#39;ll make $1K per month and from there grow it to $20K MRR. No problem.</p><p>这能有多难，对吧？我创造了一些东西，找到了10到20个客户，然后就完成了。我每个月赚1000美元，然后增长到20000美元的MRR。没问题。</p><p> Well. It didn&#39;t work that way. You all know that. I didn&#39;t. I was naive and I think I am not the only one who thinks like that.</p><p>井。但事实并非如此。你们都知道这一点。我没有。我太天真了，我想我不是唯一一个这么想的人。</p><p> News? Success stories? Books on self-help? podcasts? Guilt it of all of that. I thought I was smart enough. If other could do it... me? Even better.</p><p>有消息吗？成功的故事？关于自助的书？播客？对所有这些都感到内疚。我以为我够聪明了。如果其他人也能做到的话..。我?。甚至更好。</p><p> Well. I am broke now. I hate the projects I created. I hate that I spent all my money and didn&#39;t make a dollar (well I made around $60, which is even more painful than $0) not from my projects, not from a client or a company.</p><p>井。我现在身无分文。我讨厌我创造的项目。我讨厌我花光了所有的钱，却没有赚到一美元(我赚了大约60美元，这比0美元还要痛苦)，而不是从我的项目中，而不是从客户或公司那里。</p><p> So the real cost is more than the money I lost. I made my girlfriend stay home for a year, we didn&#39;t do anything, we didn&#39;t buy clothes and ate the cheapest food, etc. I feel that I have lost a year of my life.</p><p>所以真正的成本比我损失的钱还多。我让我的女朋友在家呆了一年，我们什么也没做，我们没有买衣服，吃了最便宜的食物等等。我觉得我已经失去了我生命中的一年。</p><p> I got much more from the articles that I wrote here on Indie Hackers than from any of my projects. And I did those in a couple of hours.</p><p>我在这里写的关于独立黑客的文章比我的任何一个项目都要多得多。我在几个小时内就完成了这些工作。</p><p>   All the time I think people are going to hate me, tell me that I am an idiot, a con maker, that my ideas are terrible, that I suck.</p><p>我一直认为人们会恨我，告诉我我是个白痴，是个骗子，我的想法很糟糕，我很烂。</p><p>   I always wanted to write more. I love it. But I felt that I couldn&#39;t write if I wasn&#39;t successful. But I guess there are no rules.</p><p>我一直想写更多的东西。我爱死它了。但我觉得，如果我不能成功，我就不能写作。但我想这是没有规则的。</p><p> So if you like my writing, please, give me a happy moment and buy me a coffee, or two:  https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jrleonr.</p><p>所以，如果你喜欢我的写作，请给我一个快乐的时刻，给我买一两杯咖啡：https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jrleonr.。</p><p>  I feel this. It&#39;s totally ok to quit, and honestly I feel like we should normalize quitting things more.</p><p>我感觉到了。戒烟完全没问题，老实说，我觉得我们应该让戒烟更常态化。</p><p> Tenacity and grind are a huge part of success, but if you believe &#34;running a business is a marathon not a sprint&#34;, then we need to accept everyone has a different pace and stamina for doing so, just like running a marathon. I say &#34;we&#34; meaning us as individuals, not so much the community. From my experience, a big part of indie hacking is knowing yourself and being able to set healthy boundaries.</p><p>坚韧不拔和吃苦耐劳是成功的重要因素，但如果你认为经营企业是一场马拉松，而不是短跑，那么我们需要承认，每个人都有不同的速度和耐力，就像跑马拉松一样。我说我们指的是我们个人，而不是整个社区。根据我的经验，独立黑客的很大一部分是了解自己，并能够设定健康的界限。</p><p> Also, few things in life are forever. If you throw up your hands and quit now, it doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t come back and revisit it in the future. But you have do what&#39;s right for you. Take care!</p><p>此外，生活中很少有东西是永恒的。如果你现在放弃了，并不意味着你以后就不能再回来了。但你必须做适合你的事。保重!。</p><p>  This is so real and I can tell it’s filled with so much passion. Unfortunately this story is common among many IndieHackers out there. It takes a real mature person to admit defeat and realize when entrepreneurship isn’t suited for them.</p><p>这是如此真实，我能感觉到它充满了激情。不幸的是，这个故事在许多IndieHacker中很常见。只有真正成熟的人才能承认失败，意识到创业不适合自己。</p><p> This topic isn’t brought up enough on this forum. As a community we celebrate things like $200 MRR, which is impressive at times, but it doesn’t pay the bills and won’t help you take the leap of faith to truly be bootstrapped.</p><p>这个话题在这个论坛上提得不够多。作为一个社区，我们庆祝200美元的MRR，这有时令人印象深刻，但它不会支付账单，也不会帮助你迈出信念的一步，真正做到自力更生。</p><p> Do you mind sharing what you think you could have changed if you started over? I, and I’m sure other IndieHackers out there, would love to know.</p><p>你介意分享一下你认为如果重新开始你会改变什么吗？我和其他IndieHacker肯定都很想知道。</p><p> Thanks for sharing this because this truly hits home for me. I thought about quitting so many times, but small hints of success pushed me through. At times, those hints of success were actually mirages and I’m sure you ran into those too.</p><p>谢谢你分享这篇文章，因为这篇文章真的切中了我的要害。我想过很多次要戒烟，但成功的小小暗示让我坚持了下来。有时候，那些成功的暗示实际上是海市蜃楼，我相信你也遇到过这样的情况。</p><p> Bootstrapping is HARD. My first two years, I walked dogs to pay my rent and maxed out my credit cards on developer spend.</p><p>自力更生是一件很难的事。在我工作的头两年，我遛狗来支付房租，在开发商的消费上刷爆了我的信用卡。</p><p>  Did same. Better to build business on the side while continuing to work. Much lower risk. Adjust and try again.</p><p>做了同样的事。最好是在继续工作的同时兼职做生意。风险要低得多。调整后重试。</p><p>  I am a game developer. I got fired April 2018. I used to make $3500 a month. I have made around 7000$ dollars in the last 2.5 years mostly all of it from freelancing. All my games flopped. I live with my parents and feel the same about the lost time as you. I don&#39;t know the purpose of this comment but I just wanted to share.</p><p>我是一名游戏开发者。我在2018年4月被解雇了。我过去一个月挣3500美元。在过去的两年半里，我赚了大约7000美元，大部分都是自由职业。我所有的游戏都失败了。我和我的父母住在一起，和你一样对失去的时光有同样的感受。我不知道这条评论的目的，但我只是想分享一下。</p><p>  Do what you love. It doesn&#39;t matter if you achieve your &#39;dreams&#39; of being an Indiehacker maker if they come at the cost of complete anxiety. You love to write, and you are obviously exceptional at it. Do what you love.</p><p>做你喜欢做的事。如果你实现了成为一名独立黑客制造者的梦想，如果这些梦想是以彻底的焦虑为代价的，那也无关紧要。你喜欢写作，显然你在这方面很出色。做你喜欢做的事。</p><p> Take the good from this year. You&#39;ve probably learnt more than you ever will in a single year of your life, you&#39;re one step closer to what you really want in life, and you tested your personal realtionship with your loves ones and yourself more than you ever thought you could. If you&#39;ve made it through this year, you can make it through any other.</p><p>把今年的好东西拿走吧。你可能学到了比你一生中任何一年都要多的东西，你离你真正想要的生活又近了一步，你比你想象中更多地测试了你与爱人和你自己的个人关系。如果你今年熬过了，其他任何一年你都能熬过去。</p><p> Good luck in the rest of your life, I hope to see you within the IH circles again (writing, not making).</p><p>祝你余生好运，我希望在IH圈子里再次见到你(写作，而不是创作)。</p><p>  👆🏻 — you nailed it. there are no rules to this. you make them up as you go along.</p><p>👆🏻-你做到了。这是没有规则的。你可以边走边编。</p><p>  he was sent to prison. but the observation &#34;he has suffered evil,&#34; is an addition coming from you.</p><p>他被送进了监狱。但是，他遭受了邪恶的折磨，这是从你口中说出来的。</p><p>  malcomx went to prison a criminal but left as an educated, motivated, and deeply religious man towards civil rights.</p><p>马尔科克斯以罪犯身份入狱，但离开时却是一个受过教育、有强烈动机、虔诚信仰的民权人士。</p><p>  Your story is humbling. It is a much needed reality check for those of us still testing the waters.</p><p>你的故事令人谦卑。对于我们这些仍在试水的人来说，这是一个亟需的现实检验。</p><p> It also got lots of veterans to share their less than glamorous experiences, so thank you for sharing it.</p><p>它也让很多退伍军人分享了他们不那么光鲜的经历，所以谢谢你的分享。</p><p> On the bright side, you’ve learnt some very expensive lessons on IH and still enjoy writing ... perhaps collect your thoughts and take some time to document your mistakes, things you could have done differently etc then publish it as an ebook  Pitfalls: Things to avoid as a bootstrapped founder?</p><p>好的一面是，你在IH上学到了一些非常昂贵的课程，但仍然喜欢写作……。也许整理一下你的想法，花些时间记录你的错误，你本可以做的不同的事情，等等，然后把它出版成一本电子书：作为一个自学成才的创始人要避免的事情？</p><p>  This. Thanks for writing this. I started getting anxiety and even bowel problem since I decided to be an &#39;indie maker&#39; a few months ago. I spent £3,000 and earned £2 from... Medium.</p><p>这。谢谢你写下这封信。自从几个月前我决定成为一名独立制作人以来，我开始感到焦虑，甚至出现了肠道问题。我花了3000英磅，从……赚了2英磅。5~6成熟。</p><p> There&#39;s a saying that &#34;it&#39;s better to love and get hurt rather than never loved at all&#34; - I believe that it&#39;s also the case here. You tried. You gave it your best shot. As you said in one of your comments, it requires braveness to quit. Good luck for your future endeavour, buddy!</p><p>有一句话说，爱而受伤总比从未被爱要好--我相信这里也是如此。你试过了。你尽了你最大的努力。正如你在其中一条评论中所说，戒烟需要勇气。祝你未来的事业好运，伙计！</p><p>  If it helps you feel any better, you should know that anxiety over marketing and pushing the business side of entrepreneurship in general is very common.</p><p>如果这能让你感觉好一些，你应该知道，对营销和推动创业的商业方面的焦虑总体上是非常普遍的。</p><p> I think if you look at most personality diagrams that side is on the opposite of being analytical, so that&#39;s kind of to be expected.</p><p>我认为，如果你看大多数个性图，你会发现这一面与分析相反，所以这在某种程度上是意料之中的。</p><p> Maybe it&#39;s an opportune time to do exactly what you&#39;re thinking about doing, work for the man for a while, earn some self-confidence back and improve the financial side of things.</p><p>也许现在正是做你正在考虑做的事情的好时机，为这个人工作一段时间，重新获得一些自信，改善财务状况。“。</p><p> If you do decide to give it another ago, maybe you should consider co-founding with some of these super-extroverted, overly confident, charismatic sales guys/girls? That way you wouldn&#39;t need to deal with the anxiety you feel when pushing the ideas/products to other people and could just enjoy creating.</p><p>如果你真的决定在之前再给一次，或许你应该考虑和这些超级外向、过于自信、有魅力的推销员们共同创立公司，或许你应该考虑与这些超级外向、过于自信、魅力十足的销售人员共同创立公司？这样一来，你就不需要处理向他人推介创意/产品时的焦虑情绪，而只是享受创造的乐趣。</p><p> All the best to you Jose, get better and thanks a bunch for this courageous post!</p><p>乔斯，祝你一切顺利，好起来，谢谢你这篇勇敢的帖子！</p><p>  Also, i think everyone struggles with fearing what others think. Recognizing that it&#39;s normal is a healthy way to start overcoming it.</p><p>此外，我认为每个人都在为害怕别人的想法而苦苦挣扎。认识到这是正常的，这是开始克服它的一种健康方式。</p><p>  Hey Josè, really sorry to read this. I could tell you that you probably learned a lot of useful things during this year but I know it&#39;s not going to make you feel better.</p><p>嘿，何塞，真的很抱歉读到这个。我可以告诉你，这一年你可能学到了很多有用的东西，但我知道这不会让你感觉好一点。</p><p> I think the lesson for other Indie Hackers (me included) here would be don&#39;t quit your job until you have a side project that starts getting some traction.</p><p>我认为这里给其他独立黑客(包括我)的教训是，在你有一个副业开始获得一些吸引力之前，不要辞去你的工作。</p><p>  Hey, I could say I am sorry to hear this, but the reality is that your story is true to so many people, it&#39;s more of a norm than an outlier. Some people get lucky and find the gem on their first try, many give up along the way, and a few more eventually figure it out and get profitable.</p><p>嘿，我可以说我很遗憾听到这个消息，但现实是，你的故事对很多人来说都是真实的，它更像是一种常态，而不是异常值。有些人很幸运，第一次尝试就找到了宝石，许多人在尝试的过程中放弃了，还有一些人最终找到了宝石，并从中获利。</p><p> As you talk to successful founders you realize that even many billion-dollar success stories were on a brink of death at least once, and often numerous times.</p><p>当你与成功的创始人交谈时，你会意识到，即使是价值数十亿美元的成功故事，也至少有一次，而且往往是无数次，都处于死亡的边缘。</p><p> The good news is that you will disconnect for a while, process, and realize how valuable this year has been to your life. It probably looks like a waste right now, but you will eventually start to appreciate it. You might even try it again sometimes, maybe even sooner than you think.</p><p>好消息是，你会暂时与外界脱节，然后意识到这一年对你的生活是多么有价值。现在这可能看起来像是浪费，但你最终会开始欣赏它的。有时你甚至可能会再试一次，甚至可能比你想象的更早。</p><p> Also, if you are game to do some part time projects, can you email me (email in profile) and let me know your tech stack. I might have some leads.</p><p>此外，如果你是游戏做一些兼职项目，你可以给我发电子邮件(电子邮件在个人资料)，让我知道你的技术堆栈。我可能有一些线索。</p><p>  If you survived, you will be able to do lot of things that you want to do.</p><p>如果你活下来了，你将能够做很多你想做的事情。</p><p> Just be grateful that you got to do all these things. Indie Hacking is not easy. Also not for everyone. That&#39;s why we have people who work at jobs (9-5) they are comfortable with.</p><p>感谢你能做所有这些事。独立黑客并不容易。也不是每个人都适合。这就是为什么我们的员工从事他们喜欢的工作(朝九晚五)的原因。</p><p> Indie Hacking is not only about earning money, but also managing the risk. The risk is being not dead.</p><p>独立黑客不仅是为了赚钱，也是为了管理风险。风险在于没有死。</p><p>  People who have been successful, had multiple shots equally, but we only see the successful events, not what they have failed at.</p><p>成功的人都有多次投篮机会，但我们只看到成功的事件，而不是他们失败的事情。</p><p>  All those stories about people dropping everything to start a company that makes a tonne of money usually miss out a lot of important info.</p><p>所有那些关于人们放弃一切去创办一家赚一吨钱的公司的故事通常会遗漏很多重要的信息。</p><p>  I&#39;d suggest taking 6 months off this totally to get things back in order then resume on evenings and weekends only.</p><p>我建议你完全休息6个月，让一切恢复正常，然后只在晚上和周末继续工作。</p><p>  Sorry to hear this man! your story resonates a lot with me, and with a lot of other indie hackers.</p><p>很遗憾听到这个人的消息！你的故事引起了我的共鸣，也引起了很多其他独立黑客的共鸣。</p><p> I lost a year and a half working on multiple side projects, all have failed. But I don&#39;t regret it, you know why? because building, creating is what I love. I was the happiest ever when I was working on those projects!</p><p>我在多个副业上浪费了一年半的时间，都失败了。但我并不后悔，你知道为什么吗？因为建造、创造是我所热爱的。当我在做这些项目的时候，我是最开心的！</p><p> You have made a good decision to quit for now, find another job, live a &#34;normal&#34; life for a year or two, then maybe if you want, you can work on side projects for fun! and then profit, that&#39;s what i&#39;m doing right now.</p><p>你已经做出了一个正确的决定，暂时辞职，另找一份工作，过上一两年正常的生活，然后如果你愿意，也许你可以做些副业来娱乐一下！然后是盈利，这就是我现在正在做的事情。</p><p>  Sorry to hear that, dude. It&#39;s definitely a tough racket and requires a lot of luck.</p><p>很遗憾听到这个消息，伙计。这绝对是一场艰苦的比赛，需要很大的运气。</p><p> I agree that promo part is tough. Many of us are just builders and love creating things, so the idea of selling our work to others feels wrong and like you indicated, stresses us because of judgment.</p><p>我同意宣传部分很艰难。我们中的许多人都只是建设者，喜欢创造东西，所以把我们的作品卖给别人的想法感觉是错误的，正如你所说的那样，因为判断而给我们带来了压力。</p><p> I just posted my app on reddit somewhere and immediately someone just downvoted it. Self-promotion is even allowed there, but somebody saw the post and thought, nah, not today.</p><p>我刚刚在Reddit上发布了我的应用程序，很快就被人否决了。那里甚至允许自我推销，但有人看到这篇帖子后想，不，不是今天。</p><p> I hope you can get back to trying to make things in a smaller capacity as a side gig or just a hobby! I&#39;m doing it as just a hobby and already realizing that I probably couldn&#39;t do it full-time like a lot of folks here.</p><p>我希望你能重新开始尝试用较小的容量制作东西，作为一项兼职工作或仅仅是一种爱好！我做这件事只是一种爱好，我已经意识到我可能不能像这里的许多人那样全职做这件事。</p><p>  If you are putting your life and loved ones at the risk of the unknown, you shouldn’t pursue it. They are important than all of indie hacking combined.</p><p>如果你把你的生命和所爱的人置于未知的危险之中，你就不应该去追求它。它们的重要性超过了所有独立黑客的总和。</p><p>  Love this. I recently killed a project I put 2 years into. It took killing it to see how wrong it was - as a business and for me as a person.</p><p>爱死这个了。我最近终止了一个我投入了两年的项目。只有杀了它，才能意识到这是多么错误--无论是作为一家企业，还是对我来说，作为一个人。</p><p> It taught me a lot tho. Like you, I put effort only into product and zero into promoting it. This time I’m starting the other way around. A product that markets itself ;)</p><p>尽管如此，它还是教会了我很多。像你一样，我只把精力放在产品上，而不是把精力放在宣传上。这一次，我从相反的方向开始。推销自己的产品；)。</p><p>  I wish you nothing less than a v-shaped recovery. Often times, the greatest wins come after tremendous losses. Maybe take what you learned and use it to fuel a micro-saas app. It sounds like you are starting to regress to a bit of &#34;impostor&#39;s syndrome&#34; because in my opinion, you are fully capable. I always thought some types of journal or goal-setting or tool for fighting impostor syndrome would be extremely cool. We often forget how capable we are. Everybody in this community is here or found this place for a reason.</p><p>我祝你一如既往地走出V型复苏之路。很多时候，最大的胜利发生在巨大的损失之后。也许把你学到的东西用来做一个微型SaaS应用。听起来你似乎开始患上一些冒名顶替者综合症，因为在我看来，你完全有能力。我一直认为，某些类型的日记、目标设定或对抗冒名顶替者综合症的工具会非常酷。我们常常忘记自己有多有能力。这个社区的每个人来到这里或找到这个地方都是有原因的。</p><p>  I see your story in myself, probably in a lot of indie makers, and there&#39;s gotta be ways around it. Do you think working on it alone was part of the problem? if there were any partners or even advisors, would it make a difference?</p><p>我在自己身上看到了你的故事，可能在很多独立制作人身上，而且肯定有办法绕过它。你认为单打独斗是问题的一部分吗？如果有任何合作伙伴甚至顾问，会有什么不同吗？</p><p>  That&#39;s tough to hear man! Hope you will find something that works for you, it&#39;s important to enjoy the ride! Cheers and enjoy your coffee ☕</p><p>这话听起来很难，伙计！希望你能找到适合你的东西，享受这段旅程很重要！干杯，享受你的咖啡☕。</p><p>  Jose - glad you took the time to share a brief post on why you&#39;re choosing to quit. Opportunity cost is a bitch.</p><p>何塞-很高兴你花时间分享了一篇简短的帖子，讲述了你为什么选择辞职。机会成本是个婊子。</p><p>  And yet here you are chaval, promoting yourself, so it&#39;s doable. I lost 5X what you lost with more time invested, more stupid decistions made and more strain on my personal life. You have to keep going.</p><p>然而，你现在是查瓦尔，在推销自己，所以这是可行的。我失去了你的5倍，因为我投入了更多的时间，做出了更愚蠢的决定，给我的个人生活带来了更大的压力。你必须继续前进。</p><p>  You quit because you lost &gt; $38k. Not because you failed. Because failure is the part of the success.</p><p>你辞职是因为你损失了3.8万美元。不是因为你失败了。因为失败是成功的一部分。</p><p>  This post is a demotivation for those who failed multiple times but still don&#39;t want to give up and continue again.....showing the pure perserverance; and now they quit. And a motivation for those who are doing extremely good. Damn!!!!</p><p>对于那些多次失败但仍然不想放弃并继续下去的人来说，这篇帖子是一种打击……表现出纯粹的毅力；现在他们放弃了。对于那些做得非常好的人来说，这也是一种动力。该死的！</p><p>  Sorry to hear this. You learned so much during this year so probably after some time you can try again.</p><p>很遗憾听到这个消息。你在这一年里学到了很多东西，所以可能过一段时间你还可以再试一次。</p><p>  What is that? What do you think is the main reason of not being successful?</p><p>那是什么？你认为失败的主要原因是什么？</p><p>  I wouldn&#39;t agree on that to be honest. Being successful means always do A/B testing and checking different hypothesises. Doing the same all time is not leading to success.</p><p>老实说，我不同意这一点。成功意味着总是做A/B测试，检查不同的假设。一如既往地做同样的事情并不能带来成功。</p><p>  I am sorry to hear this. It seems you are a very prolific product creator. Not many can make as many products as you did this year. Was the money you lost due to direct investments in your projects or the money you could have got while working in your previous job?</p><p>听到这个消息我很难过。看来你是一个非常多产的产品创造者。没有多少人能生产出像你今年这么多的产品。你损失的钱是直接投资于你的项目，还是你在以前的工作中可以得到的钱？</p><p>  Sorry to hear that dude!
