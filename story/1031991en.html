As it turned out, “D&amp;D meets NYC” was the first episode of  Dimension20: The Unsleeping City, a recurring actual play D&amp;D show. In the first five minutes, the audience is introduced to Pete the Plug, a sorcerer who is meeting with his doctor shortly after getting top surgery. I was hooked.</p><p>直到我在YouTube上看到一段名为“D&A；D遇见纽约”的视频，我才真正了解了“地下城与龙”。我和朋友玩过几次，但是我每次转弯都被绊倒了，我想我永远也学不会所有的规则。事实证明，“D&amp；D遇见纽约”是“维度20：不眠之城”(Dimension20：The Unsleing City)的第一集，这是一部重演的D&A；D秀。在前五分钟，观众被介绍给插头皮特，这是一位巫师，他在接受了顶级手术后不久就去见了他的医生。我被吸引住了。</p><p> I didn’t realize D&amp;D could look like that—that it didn’t have to exist in the medieval fantasy worlds I had seen and heard so much about. Still, it can be intimidating to break into an activity that’s so dense with jargon and rules and has a history of gatekeeping. WIRED talked to some experts on how to get started and the role of identity in tabletop role-playing games.</p><p>我没有意识到D&amp；D可以是这样的--它不一定要存在于我见过和听说过的中世纪幻想世界中。尽管如此，闯入一项充斥着行话和规则并有把关历史的活动可能会让人望而生畏。“连线”采访了一些专家，讨论如何入门，以及身份在桌面角色扮演游戏中的作用。</p><p>  The hardest part, as is true with most things, is getting started. But you really only need to get a couple of friends together and figure it out as you go, says content creator and D&amp;D performer  B. Dave Walters. “Don&#39;t stress too much about the rules,” says Walters. “Don&#39;t stress too much about what you&#39;re supposed to do.” Instead, think of your favorite fantasy movie, show, book, or even character, and go from there.</p><p>最困难的部分，就像大多数事情一样，是开始。但你真的只需要把几个朋友聚在一起，边走边想，内容创作者兼研发人员B·戴夫·沃尔特斯(B.Dave Walters)说。沃尔特斯说：“不要对规则过于强调。”“不要对你应该做的事情过分强调。”取而代之的是，想想你最喜欢的奇幻电影、电视剧、书籍，甚至是你最喜欢的角色，然后从那里开始。</p><p>  “Growing up as a little Black kid in the south, there weren&#39;t many opportunities to feel powerful,” says Walters. “And that was one of the things that D&amp;D gave me originally—a chance to feel heroic. Not just reading about superheroes or watching movies, but actually going out and living one.”</p><p>沃尔特斯说：“在南方长大的黑人小孩，没有多少机会感受到强大。”“这也是D&amp；D最初给我的东西之一--一个感受英雄气概的机会。不只是读关于超级英雄的书或看电影，而是真正走出去过超级英雄的生活。“。</p><p>  Walters has been playing D&amp;D since he was 13, but the game has changed significantly since then. “We played the first one, like something straight out of  Stranger Things sitting in your mom&#39;s basement, with the miniatures playing the crunchiest version of it,” Walters says.</p><p>沃尔特斯从13岁起就开始玩D&amp；D，但从那时起，这项运动已经发生了很大的变化。沃尔特斯说：“我们玩了第一个，就像坐在你妈妈地下室里的”陌生人的东西“里的东西一样，微缩模型播放的是最嘎吱作响的版本。”</p><p>  Today, the rules are simpler and the internet provides new players and DMs with a myriad of resources (including  glossaries on, say, what a “DM” is).</p><p>今天，规则变得更简单了，互联网为新玩家和DM提供了无数的资源(包括比如什么是“DM”的词汇表)。</p><p>  Walters recommends new players check out  D&amp;D Beyond. “One of the joys of D&amp;D is also one of the most overwhelming parts of it for new people—there&#39;s just a lot of books,” Walters says.</p><p>沃尔特斯推荐新玩家去看看D&A；D Beyond。沃尔特斯说：“研发的乐趣之一也是新人最难以抗拒的部分--书太多了。”</p><p> But you don’t need any books to get started. He describes D&amp;D Beyond as a digital tool set that has everything you need to get started, from  fillable character sheets to  rule books to digital dice.</p><p>但是你不需要任何书就可以开始学习。他将D&amp；D Beyond描述为一套数字工具，从可填写的字符表到规则手册再到数字骰子，应有尽有，应有尽有。</p><p>  Once you have the basics down, it’s time to form a party. All you really need to do is find a group of people who also want to play. There are  websites and  subreddits you can tap if you can’t find takers in your real life.</p><p>一旦你有了基本的东西，就是组建政党的时候了。你真正需要做的就是找到一群也想玩的人。如果你在现实生活中找不到应聘者，你可以访问一些网站和附属网站。</p><p> But it can be valuable to find people from similar, underrepresented demographics and backgrounds like your own.</p><p>但是，找到像你这样有着相似的、代表性不足的人口统计和背景的人是很有价值的。</p><p> Kelly Lynne D’Angelo, writer and dungeon master for   Girls, Guts, Glory, said DM-ing for an all-woman show was a breath of fresh air. “It was a completely different experience,” D’Angelo said. “I felt like when we sat around the table there was sort of a preciousness that we all recognized.</p><p>凯莉·林恩·D‘Angelo是“女孩，勇气，荣耀”的编剧和地牢大师，她说，为了一场全女性演出而进行DM-ing是一种新鲜空气。“这是一种完全不同的体验，”D‘Angelo说。“我觉得当我们围坐在桌子旁时，有一种我们都认识到的珍贵。</p><p>  “We are oral storytellers, my tribe. That&#39;s how knowledge is passed on, how information and culture and our livelihood are passed on,” D’Angelo says. And D&amp;D is, in many ways, another form of oral storytelling. When D’Angelo first sat down with her all-Native party, she said it felt like “fireworks exploding my heart.”</p><p>“我们是口头讲故事的人，我的部落。知识就是这样传递的，信息、文化和我们的生计就是这样传递的，“D‘Angelo说。在许多方面，D&amp；D是另一种口头讲故事的形式。当D‘Angelo第一次与她的全土著政党坐在一起时，她说感觉就像“烟花炸毁了我的心”。</p><p>  “Because this is what our ancestors would have wanted,” D’Angelo says. “And our ancestors are celebrating the fact that we&#39;re alive and present, and we&#39;re still creating stories to this day.”</p><p>“因为这是我们的祖先所希望的，”D‘Angelo说。“我们的祖先正在庆祝这样一个事实：我们还活着，现在还活着，直到今天，我们还在创造故事。”</p><p>  If you feel like you’d be more comfortable playing with others who understand your background, find those people.</p><p>如果你觉得和了解你背景的人一起玩会更舒服，那就去找那些人。</p><p> People play for a lot of different reasons—some are more interested in the combat and tactics of the game, while others may be more interested in the role-playing and storytelling. But those different interests and approaches can coalesce at the right table as long as everyone is invested in the game and in each other.</p><p>人们玩游戏有很多不同的原因-一些人对游戏的战斗和战术更感兴趣，而另一些人可能对角色扮演和讲故事更感兴趣。但是，只要每个人都投入到游戏中和彼此身上，这些不同的利益和方法就可以在正确的桌子上结合起来。</p><p>  Before you start playing, you have to build a character. In D&amp;D 5th Edition, there are  14 classes and even more  races depending on how creative you want to get. There’s nothing wrong with basing your character off a fictional character you already know and love, but here are some other things to consider.</p><p>在你开始演奏之前，你必须塑造一个角色。在D&amp；D 5版中，有14个职业，甚至更多的比赛，这取决于你想要获得多大的创造力。把你的角色建立在一个你已经知道并喜欢的虚构角色的基础上并没有错，但这里有一些其他的需要考虑的事情。</p><p> Picking a race and class, and building your character sheet is important, but motivation is equally important and can also help inform those choices. Brennan Lee Mulligan, host and dungeon master of   Dimension 20, says it can be tempting to create a fully formed character, but you’ll have more success building a character who has something to gain from joining a party and going on an adventure.</p><p>选择一个种族和职业，建立你的角色表很重要，但动机也同样重要，也可以帮助你做出这些选择。“维度20”的主持人兼地牢大师布伦南·李·穆利根说，塑造一个完全成型的角色是很诱人的，但你会更成功地塑造一个从参加派对和冒险中获益的角色。</p><p> “The best thing you can do for your PC (player character) is build them around the idea that this is a person who wants to go on an adventure,” says Mulligan. “This is a person who maybe has room in their story, to make these new friends and find this new family of who these other heroes are going to be.”</p><p>穆利根说：“你能为你的PC(玩家角色)做的最好的事情就是让他们相信这是一个想去冒险的人。”“这是一个在他们的故事中可能有空间的人，可以结交这些新朋友，找到这些其他英雄将要成为的这个新家庭。”</p><p> Your character can also help with self-discovery outside of the campaign.  Dimension 20 cast member Ally Beardsley played a cis woman in the first season of  Dimension 20 and a transgender man (the aforementioned Pete the Plug) in the second, as they worked through their own gender identity.</p><p>你的角色也可以帮助你在战役之外发现自我。《维度20》的演员艾丽·比尔兹利在《维度20》第一季中饰演一个顺式女人，在第二季中扮演一名变性人(前述的彼特即塞子)，因为他们都在努力寻找自己的性别认同。</p><p> “It was a huge thing on my mind of transitioning and what that looks like for me and what of the à la carte options I was going to choose to pursue,” says Beardsley. “So it was fun to be like, yeah, this is an option I&#39;m considering, let&#39;s play that.”</p><p>比尔兹利说：“过渡对我来说是一件很重要的事情，对我来说是什么样子，我要选择的点菜选择是什么。”“所以说，是的，这是我正在考虑的一个选择，让我们来玩这个游戏，这是一件很有趣的事情。”</p><p> Beardsley intentionally made their character transgender, but made sure that wasn’t the focal point of his character arc.</p><p>比尔兹利故意让他们的角色变性人，但确保这不是他角色弧线的焦点。</p><p>  “This guy is just a dude in New York City. It is a part of his reality that he&#39;s trans, maybe he takes T, but that wasn&#39;t the headline. The headline was that he sees magic,” Beardsley says. “His transness doesn’t eclipse him, which was fun because that’s real.”</p><p>“这家伙只是个纽约市的人。他是变性人，这是他现实的一部分，也许他是T，但这不是头条新闻。标题是他看到了魔术，“比尔兹利说。“他的凌日并没有让他黯然失色，这很有趣，因为那是真实的。”</p><p> Your character can really be anything you want, and it can even be, in some sense,  you, if that’s what you choose.</p><p>你的角色真的可以是你想要的任何东西，在某种意义上，甚至可以是你，如果你选择的话。</p><p> “I personally grab onto parts of myself that I&#39;m excited to like, see and explore,” says  Dimension 20 cast member Lou Wilson. “When I create characters, the performances I&#39;m able to give as my characters are exciting and good because you&#39;re watching me be me.”</p><p>《维度20》的演员卢·威尔逊说：“我个人抓住自己身上让我兴奋地喜欢、看和探索的部分。”“当我塑造角色时，我能像我的角色一样表演出令人兴奋和精彩的表演，因为你们都在看我做我自己。”</p><p> There is a vulnerability to that, though, Wilson says, and it’s essential to honor that as well. Putting yourself out there can be challenging, because if someone makes fun of your character, it can often feel like they’re making fun of you.</p><p>然而，威尔逊说，这是有弱点的，尊重这一点也是至关重要的。把自己放在那里可能很有挑战性，因为如果有人取笑你的角色，往往会觉得他们在取笑你。</p><p> “But I think that being vulnerable, really, is going to lead to the most exciting, well-rounded characters that people enjoy playing. Because once you are playing them you know exactly what you&#39;re working with,” Wilson says.</p><p>“但我认为，脆弱真的会带来人们喜欢扮演的最令人兴奋、最全面的角色。”因为一旦你玩了他们，你就会确切地知道你在和什么打交道，“威尔逊说。</p><p>  Wilson says he has had some of his favorite experiences playing D&amp;D professionally, and wished he had it when he was younger.</p><p>威尔逊说，他有过一些最喜欢的职业研发经历，希望自己年轻时就有这样的经历。</p><p> “I really want to encourage people of color who are interested in or thought about playing D&amp;D to do so,” Wilson said. “There&#39;s a lot in society and in the narrative that suggests that this game is not for us. But I think we play this game better because of the depth of our own narratives that we carry from a cultural sense and how much those aren&#39;t represented in the traditional fantasy realms.”</p><p>威尔逊说：“我真的想鼓励对研发感兴趣或想玩研发的有色人种这样做。”“社会和叙事中有很多东西表明这个游戏不适合我们。但我认为我们在这场游戏中玩得更好，是因为我们从文化的角度讲述了我们自己的故事的深度，以及这些故事在传统的幻想领域中有多少没有表现出来。“。</p><p>  Your first time playing can be nerve-wracking, especially when you aren’t sure what to expect. But if you’re playing with people you trust and respect, it can also be very healing. When Krystina Tigner’s father passed away in April, she was struggling to grieve in the way she wanted, due to the nature of Covid-19. Tigner, an actor and Critical Role cast member, says that D&amp;D was helpful in her grieving process. “I found myself having moments in-game where I just broke down in the middle, like there was this crack between myself and my character,” Tigner said.</p><p>第一次玩可能会让你伤脑筋，特别是当你不确定会发生什么的时候。但是，如果你和你信任和尊敬的人一起玩，这也可以很好地治愈你的伤痛。当克里斯蒂娜·泰格纳的父亲在4月份去世时，由于新冠肺炎的性格，她正在努力以自己想要的方式哀悼。泰格纳是一名演员和关键角色演员，她说研发部门在她的悲痛过程中起到了帮助作用。泰格纳说：“我发现自己在游戏中有过一些瞬间，我只是在中间崩溃了，就像我和我的角色之间有一条裂缝。”</p><p>  Over the years, she says, she’s used D&amp;D to work through her trauma as well. “It&#39;s a very powerful thing, and I think it&#39;s important to know that it&#39;s not just a bunch of nerds playing a game, but it is people playing together and feeling and connecting,” Tigner says.</p><p>她说，多年来，她也用D&A；D来解决她的创伤。泰格纳说：“这是一件非常强大的事情，我认为重要的是要知道，这不仅仅是一群书呆子在玩游戏，而是人们在一起玩，感受和联系。”</p><p> While in-person D&amp;D is great, Tigner notes there are some benefits to virtual gameplay as well. “You&#39;ve got this virtual table that we can take advantage of, to interface with each other, and that closeness is important,” says Tigner.</p><p>虽然面对面研发很棒，但泰格纳指出，虚拟游戏也有一些好处。泰格纳说：“你有这张虚拟桌子，我们可以利用它来相互交流，这种亲密性很重要。”</p><p>  If you’ve gotten the basics of the game down, or you just can’t find anyone else who wants to do it, it may be time to try your hand at DM-ing. Being a dungeon master—or game master if you’re playing a different tabletop game—comes with its own set of rules and stories you have to keep in your head. Luckily, you’re not the first one to do it.</p><p>如果你已经掌握了这个游戏的基本知识，或者你就是找不到其他想要做这件事的人，那么可能是时候尝试一下DM了。成为一名地下城高手--如果你玩的是不同的桌面游戏，那就是游戏高手--你必须牢记自己的一套规则和故事。幸运的是，你不是第一个这么做的人。</p><p> There are plenty of  prewritten adventures that you can adapt to your table, and plenty of  maps designed by other enthusiasts that you can use in  Roll20 if you’re playing with friends virtually. It’s also important to make sure that your players feel comfortable at the table.</p><p>有很多预先编写好的冒险游戏可以适应你的桌子，还有很多由其他爱好者设计的地图，如果你在网上和朋友一起玩，你可以在Roll20中使用它们。同样重要的是要确保你的球员在桌上感觉舒服。</p><p> Mulligan suggests giving your characters scenes of their own to get into character during the first session, “rather than just being like, ‘OK, we&#39;re going to Tavern, what&#39;s everybody doing,’ which is a great way for someone who&#39;s a little bit shyer to feel steamrolled.”</p><p>穆里根建议，让你的角色在第一阶段进入角色，“而不是简单地说，‘好吧，我们要去酒馆，每个人都在做什么’，这对于有点害羞的人来说是一个很好的方式，让他们感觉被蒸汽吞噬了。”</p><p> For example, he suggests a scene where the character is in their element, or accomplishing something important to them, so the player behind the character feels more confident from the beginning.</p><p>例如，他建议一个场景，在这个场景中，角色处于他们的元素中，或者完成了对他们来说很重要的事情，这样角色背后的玩家从一开始就感觉更有信心。</p><p> And while having a story in place will help move the game along, D&amp;D is a collaborative effort, and your players’ input is extremely valuable.</p><p>虽然有一个适当的故事将有助于游戏的发展，但研发是一个协作的努力，你的玩家的投入是非常有价值的。</p><p> “When people feel railroaded, they will resist it,” says Walters. “You&#39;re there to paint the scene for them to have a meaningful experience, but in the process,  you get to have meaningful experiences. You get to see their joy, and as you&#39;re playing off of them, they will push you to new and different heights.”</p><p>沃尔特斯说：“当人们感到不堪重负时，他们就会抵制。”“你在那里画场景，让他们有有意义的体验，但在这个过程中，你会有有意义的体验。”你可以看到他们的快乐，当你玩弄他们的时候，他们会把你推向新的、不同的高度。“。</p><p>  Watching actual play shows like   Critical Role,   Dimension 20,   The Adventure Zone, or   Girls, Guts, Glory can provide inspiration for your storytelling and your style as a dungeon master. But don’t worry about holding yourself to the standard of the professionals.</p><p>观看诸如“关键角色”、“维度20”、“冒险区”或“女孩，勇气，荣耀”这样的真人秀节目可以为你的故事讲述和作为地下城大师的风格提供灵感。但是不要担心让自己达到专业人士的标准。</p><p> “You can&#39;t do what we do, but we also can&#39;t do what you do,” Walters says. “Sing your song, and let your friends and people at your table share that wonderful experience with you.”</p><p>“你不能做我们做的事，但我们也不能做你做的事，”沃尔特斯说。“唱你的歌，让你的朋友和同桌的人与你分享那美妙的经历。”</p><p>   📱 Torn between the latest phones?
