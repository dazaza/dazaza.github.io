They’re family home videos from my childhood.</p><p>在过去的八年里，我带着这盒录像带走遍了四个不同的公寓和一所房子。这是我童年时的家庭录像。</p><p>   After 600+ hours of work, I finally digitized and organized them well enough to throw away the original tapes. Here’s what the footage looks like now:</p><p>经过600多个小时的工作，我终于把它们数字化，整理得足够好，可以扔掉原始磁带。下面是视频现在的样子：</p><p>  There are 513 separate clips, each with a title, description, a recording date, tags for everyone in the video, and everyone’s ages at the time of the recording. I host everything on a private media-sharing website that only my family can access, and it costs less than $1 per month to keep it running.</p><p>共有513个单独的剪辑，每个剪辑都有标题、描述、录制日期、视频中每个人的标签以及录制时每个人的年龄。我把所有东西都放在一个私人媒体共享网站上，只有我的家人才能访问这个网站，每月的运营费用不到1美元。</p><p> This post explains how I did it, why it took me eight years, and how you can achieve the same thing with slightly less effort.</p><p>这篇文章解释了我是如何做到的，为什么我花了八年的时间，以及你如何用稍微少一点的努力就能完成同样的事情。</p><p>  Around 2010, my mom bought some sort of VHS to DVD converter and ran all of our home videos through it.</p><p>大约在2010年，我妈妈买了一台VHS到DVD的转换器，我们所有的家庭视频都通过它播放。</p><p>   The problem was that there was only one set of DVDs. Everyone in my family lived in a different state, which made it inconvenient to pass discs around.</p><p>问题是只有一套DVD。我家里的每个人都住在不同的州，这使得分发光盘很不方便。</p><p> In 2012, my sister gave me the DVDs. I ripped them to video files and threw them all up on cloud storage. Problem solved!</p><p>2012年，我姐姐给了我DVD。我把它们撕成了视频文件，然后都放到了云存储上。问题解决了！</p><p>   A few weeks later, I asked if anyone had watched the tapes. Nobody had. I hadn’t either. In the age of YouTube, it seemed so boring to download a 3-hour mystery file in search of interesting footage.</p><p>几周后，我问是否有人看过录像带。没人见过。我也没有。在YouTube的时代，为了寻找有趣的镜头而下载一个3小时的神秘文件似乎很无聊。</p><p> The only one excited was my mom. “Okay, great,” she said, “Now, can I  finally throw out all these tapes?”</p><p>唯一兴奋的是我妈妈。“好的，太好了，”她说，“现在，我终于可以扔掉所有这些录像带了吗？”</p><p> Uh oh. That was a scary question. What if there were tapes that we missed? What if we could digitize at a higher quality? What if there was interesting information on the VHS tape labels?</p><p>啊哦。这是个可怕的问题。如果我们错过了录像带呢？如果我们能以更高的质量进行数字化会怎么样？如果录像带标签上有有趣的信息怎么办？</p><p> I’d never feel comfortable throwing away the original tapes until I was confident that we had a comprehensive capture of all the videos at the highest possible quality. That meant doing the work myself.</p><p>除非我确信我们以尽可能高的质量全面捕获了所有的视频，否则我永远不会觉得丢弃原始的录像带是一件很舒服的事情。那就意味着我自己来做这项工作。</p><p>   If you’re wondering why this took me eight years and hundreds of hours, I don’t blame you. I thought it would be an easy project too.</p><p>如果你想知道为什么我花了八年零几百个小时，我不怪你。我想这也会是一个很容易的项目。</p><p>    Or rather, that’s what the digitization process looks like in theory. Here’s what it looked like in practice:</p><p>或者更确切地说，这就是数字化过程在理论上的样子。以下是它在实践中的样子：</p><p>   Most of the time I spent was in re-work. I’d complete a stage only to discover a flaw in my technique one or two steps later. For example, I captured video from 20 tapes before realizing that the audio was slightly out of sync. Or I discovered after weeks of editing that I’d been exporting video in a format that doesn’t support online streaming.</p><p>我大部分的时间都花在返工上。我会完成一个阶段，但在一两个步骤之后才发现我的技术中有一个缺陷。例如，在意识到音频稍微不同步之前，我从20盘磁带中捕获了视频。或者，经过几周的编辑后，我发现我一直在以一种不支持在线流媒体的格式导出视频。</p><p> For the sake of everyone’s sanity, I’m explaining the process as if it had continual forward motion instead of constantly forcing my readers to jump backward and restart along with me.</p><p>为了每个人的理智，我解释这个过程就好像它有持续的向前运动，而不是不断地强迫我的读者向后跳跃，和我一起重新开始。</p><p>  Okay, back to 2012. My mom was eager to end her 20-year custodianship of the family home videos, so the next time I saw her, she handed me a huge cardboard box of videotapes. My digitization adventure had begun.</p><p>好的，回到2012年。我妈妈急于结束对家庭录像长达20年的看管，所以当我再次见到她时，她递给我一个装录像带的大纸盒。我的数字化之旅开始了。</p><p> The obvious solution would be to outsource it to a professional. There are plenty of digitization companies, including businesses that specialize in processing old home videos.</p><p>显而易见的解决方案是将其外包给专业人士。有很多数字化公司，包括专门处理旧家庭视频的企业。</p><p> I’m reasonably privacy-sensitive, so I felt uncomfortable handing strangers footage that includes me potty training (at the appropriate age; nothing weird!). Besides, I thought, how hard could it be to digitize video?</p><p>我对隐私相当敏感，所以递给陌生人包括我如厕训练的录像带(在适当的年龄，没有什么奇怪的！)让我感到不舒服。此外，我想，把视频数字化能有多难呢？</p><p>   The old family VCR was still in my dad’s basement, so I asked him to dig it out next time we met for lunch. I bought a  cheap RCA to USB adaptor from Amazon, and I was off to the races.</p><p>老家的录像机还在我爸爸的地下室里，所以我让他下次我们见面吃午饭时把它找出来。我从亚马逊买了一个便宜的RCA转USB适配器，然后我就去参加比赛了。</p><p>   To process the video from the USB capture device, I used VirtualDub, which was a bit dated in 2012, but not  that dated.</p><p>为了处理来自USB采集设备的视频，我使用了VirtualDub，它的日期是2012年的一点，但不是那个日期。</p><p>    As I started the editing process, I realized that the audio and video were slightly out of sync. Okay, no problem. I can shift the audio a little bit.</p><p>当我开始编辑过程时，我意识到音频和视频有点不同步。好的，没问题。我可以把音频稍微调一下。</p><p> Ten minutes later, it was out of sync again. Did I not shift it enough the first time?</p><p>十分钟后，它又不同步了。我是不是第一次移位不够？</p><p> It slowly dawned on me that the audio and video weren’t simply offset — they captured at different rates. They diverged more and more throughout the tape. To keep them in sync, I’d repeatedly have to adjust the audio manually every few minutes of tape.</p><p>我慢慢地意识到，音频和视频并不是简单地被抵消-它们以不同的速率捕获。在整个录像带中，他们的分歧越来越大。为了使它们保持同步，我必须每隔几分钟手动调整一次磁带的音频。</p><p>   Do you know how difficult it is to distinguish between a sound that occurs 10 milliseconds too early or 10 milliseconds too late? It’s tough! Judge for yourself.</p><p>你知道区分提前10毫秒和晚10毫秒发出的声音有多难吗？太难了！你自己判断吧。</p><p> Here’s a video of me playing with my poor, patient kitten Black Magic. The audio is slightly out of sync with the video. Is the audio ahead of the video or behind it?</p><p>这是一段我和我可怜的耐心的小猫黑魔法玩耍的视频。音频与视频略有不同步。音频是在视频的前面还是后面？</p><p>     Maybe I should spend an extra hundred dollars instead of wasting hundreds of hours  🔗︎</p><p>也许我应该多花一百美元，而不是浪费几百个小时🔗︎。</p><p> Audio correction alone took hours of tedious, maddening work. It finally occurred to me that I might avoid this headache if I chose something other than Amazon’s cheapest video capture device. After a bit more research, I bought a new one:</p><p>仅音频校正一项就耗费了数小时乏味、令人抓狂的工作。我终于想到，如果我选择亚马逊最便宜的视频捕获设备之外的其他设备，我可能会避免这个令人头疼的问题。在进一步研究之后，我买了一个新的：</p><p>     Maybe it was the VCR.  Digitization forums said audio skew wouldn’t happen with a VCR that had a “time-based corrector” (TBC), a common feature on Super VHS (S-VHS) VCRs.</p><p>也许是录像机的问题。数字化论坛表示，拥有“基于时间的校正器”(TBC)的VCR不会出现音频失真，TBC是超级VHS(S-VHS)录像机的常见功能。</p><p> Of course! What was I doing messing around with my dumb  regular VCR when there was a  super VCR that could solve my problem?</p><p>当然了!。当有一台超级录像机可以解决我的问题时，我在我那愚蠢的普通录像机上胡闹什么呢？</p><p> Nobody makes S-VHS VCRs anymore, but they’re still available on eBay. I spent $179 on a JVC SR-V10U, a VCR model that’s supposedly well-suited to VHS digitization:</p><p>现在已经没有人生产S-VHS录像机了，但它们仍然可以在易趣上买到。我花179美元买了一台JVC SR-V10U，这是一款录像机，据说非常适合VHS数字化：</p><p>   The super VCR arrived in the mail. After months of struggling with mismatched sound, I was overjoyed to have right in my hands the equipment that promised to solve all my problems.</p><p>超级录像机寄来了。在与不匹配的声音作了几个月的斗争之后，我欣喜若狂，因为我手中有了承诺可以解决我所有问题的设备。</p><p> I opened the box, hooked everything up, and the audio was still out of sync. Sigh.</p><p>我打开盒子，把所有东西都接上了，但音频还是不同步。叹气。</p><p>  Troubleshooting my hardware was miserable. I’d haul all the equipment out of my closet, crawl behind my desktop to plug everything in, try a capture, and see that it didn’t work.</p><p>排除我的硬件故障太痛苦了。我会把所有的设备从衣柜里拖出来，爬到桌面后面把所有东西都插上，试着抓拍，然后发现它不工作。</p><p> Oh, a random forum post from 2008 says to install some sketchy, unsigned Chinese device driver? It’s a terrible idea, but I’m desperate. It doesn’t fix the problem.</p><p>哦，2008年论坛上的一篇随机帖子说要安装一些粗略的、未签名的中文设备驱动程序？这是个糟糕的主意，但我已经绝望了。这并不能解决问题。</p><p> I tried different capturing software. I bought a  special VHS tape to clean the magnetic heads of my VCR. I bought a  third capture device. The results were always the same.</p><p>我试过不同的抓拍软件。我买了一盘特制的录像带来清洗录像机的磁头。我买了第三个捕捉装置。结果总是一样的。</p><p> Invariably, I’d give up, disconnect everything, and banish the equipment to my closet for another few months.</p><p>一成不变地，我会放弃，切断一切，再把设备放逐到我的衣柜里几个月。</p><p>  Fast forward to 2018. I had dragged these videotapes and tons of equipment to four different apartments, and I was preparing to  move from New York City to Massachusetts. I couldn’t justify moving this stuff again when it had become clear that I’d never finish the project on my own.</p><p>快进到2018年。我把这些录像带和成吨的设备拖到四个不同的公寓，准备从纽约市搬到马萨诸塞州。当事情变得很明显，我永远不可能独自完成这个项目时，我无法证明再次搬走这些东西是合理的。</p><p> I asked my family if they’d be comfortable with me sending the tapes to a digitization company. Fortunately, nobody minded — they were all much more interested in seeing the footage again.</p><p>我问我的家人，如果我把录像带送到数字化公司，他们会不会介意。幸运的是，没有人介意-他们都对再次观看这段视频更感兴趣。</p><p> Me: But it means some company has access to all of our home videos. You’re okay with that?  My sister: Yeah, I don’t care. You’re the only one who worries about that. Wait, you could have just paid someone to do that from the start?  Me: Uh…</p><p>我：但这意味着有一家公司可以访问我们所有的家庭录像带。你不介意吧？我妹妹：是的，我不在乎。你是唯一担心这个的人。等等，你可以从一开始就付钱让人这么做吗？我：呃，…。</p><p> It cost $750 to digitize all 45 tapes. That may sound expensive, but by that point, I would have paid anything to avoid another minute of troubleshooting video equipment.</p><p>将全部45盘磁带数字化需要750美元。这听起来可能很贵，但到那时，为了避免再花一分钟排除视频设备的故障，我会不惜一切代价。</p><p> When the files came back, the quality was undisputably better. My captures always had “tearing” around the edges, but the specialists digitized everything without any distortion. Best of all, the audio and video synced up perfectly.</p><p>当文件回来时，质量无疑更好了。我拍摄的照片总是有“撕裂”的边缘，但专家们把所有东西都数字化了，没有任何失真。最棒的是，音频和视频完美同步。</p><p> Here’s a video that compares the digitization company’s capture with one of my own:</p><p>以下是一段视频，它将数字化公司的截图与我自己的截图进行了比较：</p><p>   With home videos, about 90% of the footage is boring, 8% is entertaining, and 2% is amazing. After you digitize the tapes, there’s still lots of work to do.</p><p>有了家庭视频，大约90%的镜头是枯燥的，8%是娱乐性的，2%是令人惊叹的。录像带数字化后，还有很多工作要做。</p><p>  VHS tapes contain a long stream of video clips mixed with dead air. To edit a tape, you have to identify where each clip starts and ends.</p><p>录像带里有一长串混杂着死气沉沉的视频短片。要编辑磁带，您必须确定每个剪辑的开始和结束位置。</p><p> For my editing, I used  Adobe Premiere Elements, which costs less than $100 for a lifetime license. Its crucial feature for editing VHS tapes is the zoomable timeline. It allows you to find rough scene boundaries quickly and then zoom in to find the exact video frame where a clip starts or ends.</p><p>我使用Adobe Premiere Elements进行编辑，终身许可的费用不到100美元。它编辑VHS磁带的关键功能是可缩放的时间线。它允许您快速查找粗略的场景边界，然后放大以查找剪辑开始或结束的准确视频帧。</p><p>   The problem with Premiere is that it requires frequent starting and stopping. My process was:</p><p>Premiere的问题在于它需要频繁的启动和停止。我的流程是：</p><p>  The long waits meant that I was constantly context-switching between video editing and some other task, scrambling my focus for hours</p><p>漫长的等待意味着我不断地在视频编辑和其他一些任务之间切换上下文，使我的注意力混乱了几个小时。</p><p> The other drawback was non-reproducibility. Fixing a small error was almost as hard as doing the entire thing from scratch. That bit me hard when I reached the video-sharing stage. Only then did I realize I should have been exporting the videos in a format that web browsers could stream natively. My options were to restart the tedious process of exporting hundreds of clips or to re-encode the exported videos to another format, degrading their quality.</p><p>另一个缺点是不可重复性。修复一个小错误几乎和从头开始做整个事情一样难。当我进入视频分享阶段时，这狠狠地咬了我一口。直到那时，我才意识到我应该以一种网络浏览器可以原生流媒体的格式导出视频。我的选择是重新开始导出数百个剪辑的繁琐过程，或者将导出的视频重新编码为另一种格式，从而降低它们的质量。</p><p>  After an embarrassing number of hours doing everything by hand, I wondered if I could simply throw artificial intelligence at the problem. Identifying clip boundaries seemed like a suitable machine learning task. I knew that accuracy would be less than perfect, but maybe it could do 80% of the work, and I’d fix the last 20% manually.</p><p>在经历了令人尴尬的几个小时后，我想知道是否可以简单地将人工智能投入到这个问题中。识别剪辑边界似乎是一项合适的机器学习任务。我知道精确度不会那么完美，但也许它可以完成80%的工作，剩下的20%我可以手动修复。</p><p> I experimented with a tool called  pyscenedetect, which analyzes video files and prints out the timecodes where scene changes occur:</p><p>我试用了一个名为pyscenedetect的工具，它分析视频文件并打印出场景发生变化的时间码：</p><p> $ docker run  \  --volume  &#34;/videos:/opt&#34;  \  handflucht/pyscenedetect  \  --input /opt/test.mp4  \  --output /opt  \  detect-content --threshold  80  \  list-scenes[PySceneDetect] Output directory set: /opt[PySceneDetect] Loaded  1 video, framerate: 29.97 FPS, resolution:  720 x  480[PySceneDetect] Downscale factor  set to 3, effective resolution:  240 x  160[PySceneDetect] Scene list CSV file name format:  $VIDEO_NAME-Scenes.csv[PySceneDetect] Detecting scenes...[PySceneDetect] Processed  55135 frames in 117.6 seconds (average 468.96 FPS).[PySceneDetect] Detected  33 scenes, average shot length 55.7 seconds.[PySceneDetect] Writing scene list to CSV file: /opt/test-Scenes.csv[PySceneDetect] Scene List:----------------------------------------------------------------------- | Scene  # | Start Frame | Start Time | End Frame | End Time |----------------------------------------------------------------------- |  1 |  0 | 00:00:00.000 |  1011 | 00:00:33.734 | |  2 |  1011 | 00:00:33.734 |  1292 | 00:00:43.110 | |  3 |  1292 | 00:00:43.110 |  1878 | 00:01:02.663 | |  4 |  1878 | 00:01:02.663 |  2027 | 00:01:07.634 | ...</p><p>$docker run\--volume&#34；/video：/opt&#34；\handflucht/pysceneDetect\--input/opt/test.mp4\-output/opt\Detect-Content--Threshold 80\List-Scenes[PySceneDetect]输出目录集：/opt[PySceneDetect]已加载1个视频，帧率：29.97 FPS，分辨率：720 x 480[PySceneDetect]缩小因子设置为3，有效分辨率：240x160[PySceneDetect]场景列表csv文件名格式：$VIDEO_NAME-Scenes.csv[PySceneDetect]检测场景...[PySceneDetect]在117.6秒内处理了55135帧，平均每秒468.96帧。[PySceneDetect]检测到33个场景。平均镜头长度55.7秒。[PySceneDetect]正在将场景列表写入csv文件：/opt/test-Scenes.csv[PySceneDetect]场景List：----|场景#|开始帧|开始时间|开始时间|结束帧|结束时间。|----|1|0|00：00：00.000|1011|00：00：33.734||2|1011|00：00：33.734|1292|00：00：43.110||3。|1292|00：00：43.110|1878|00：01：02.663||4|1878|00：01：02.663|2027|00：01：07.634|...。</p><p> It was indeed about 80% accurate, but checking the tool’s work took more time than it saved me. Nevertheless, pyscenedetect sparked one of my most important realizations of this entire project: identifying scene boundaries and exporting clips are separate tasks.</p><p>它确实有80%的准确率，但是检查工具的工作花费的时间比节省的时间还多。然而，pyscenedetect引发了我对整个项目最重要的认识之一：识别场景边界和导出剪辑是两个独立的任务。</p><p>  Until that point, I had thought of “editing” as everything I was doing in Adobe Premiere. Chopping out subclips of raw footage felt inextricably tied to finding clip boundaries because that’s how Premiere presented it. When pyscenedetect printed out its table of metadata, it made me realize I could decouple scene finding from video exporting. That was a gamechanger.</p><p>在此之前，我一直认为“编辑”是我在Adobe Premiere中所做的一切。剪下原始镜头的子剪辑感觉与寻找剪辑边界密不可分，因为这就是Premiere呈现它的方式。当pyscenedetect打印出它的元数据表时，它让我意识到我可以将场景查找与视频导出分离。那是个游戏机。</p><p> The reason that editing was so tedious and time-consuming was that I had to keep waiting for Premiere to export each clip. If I recorded the metadata in a spreadsheet and wrote a script that exported videos automatically, the editing process would fly by.</p><p>剪辑如此乏味和耗时的原因是我不得不一直等待Premiere导出每个剪辑。如果我将元数据记录在电子表格中，并编写一个自动导出视频的脚本，编辑过程就会飞快地过去。</p><p> What’s more, spreadsheets dramatically expanded the type of information I captured. Initially, I stuffed metadata into the filename, but that’s limiting and inflexible. Having an entire spreadsheet allowed me to catalog so much more about the clip like who’s in it, when it was recorded, and any other data I want to present alongside the video when people watch it.</p><p>更重要的是，电子表格极大地扩展了我捕获的信息类型。最初，我将元数据填充到文件名中，但这是有限且不灵活的。有了一个完整的电子表格，我就可以对剪辑进行更多的分类，比如谁在里面，什么时候录制的，以及当人们观看视频时我想要在视频旁边展示的任何其他数据。</p><p>   Later, I was able to use that metadata to add information to the clips like how old we all were and a detailed description of what’s going on in the clip.</p><p>后来，我可以使用这些元数据将信息添加到剪辑中，比如我们都有多大年龄，以及剪辑中发生的事情的详细描述。</p><p>    With the spreadsheet in hand, I  wrote a script that chopped my raw videos into smaller clips based on a CSV input.</p><p>有了电子表格，我编写了一个脚本，根据CSV输入将我的原始视频切成较小的剪辑。</p><p>  At this point, I’d spent  hundreds of hours tediously selecting clip boundaries in Premiere, hitting export, waiting a few minutes for it to complete, then starting over. Not only that, I had repeated this process several times on the same footage after discovering quality problems later on.</p><p>在这一点上，我已经花了数百个小时在Premiere中乏味地选择剪辑边界，点击导出，等待几分钟完成，然后重新开始。不仅如此，在后来发现质量问题后，我在同一个片段上重复了几次这个过程。</p><p> Once I automated the clip slicing part, it was a massive weight off my shoulders. I didn’t have to worry about forgetting metadata or picking the wrong output format. If I discovered a mistake after the fact, I could just tweak my script and rerun everything.</p><p>一旦我实现了剪辑部分的自动化，我的肩膀上就减轻了很大的负担。我不必担心忘记元数据或选择错误的输出格式。如果事后发现错误，我只需调整脚本并重新运行所有内容。</p><p>  Capturing and editing the clips was only half the battle.
