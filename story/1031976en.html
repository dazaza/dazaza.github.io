With more than a dozen we talked a little closer and many of them we&#39;ve shown you. However, amongst the sea of amazing new innovations in the remote work space, we still found gaps.</p><p>在2020年的研究中，我们很高兴与94(！)。远程工具公司了解他们在做什么。与十几个人一起，我们谈得稍微近了一些，其中许多我们已经给你看过了。然而，在远程工作空间中令人惊叹的新创新的海洋中，我们仍然发现了差距。</p><p>  Struggles we&#39;ve heard from remote teams that don&#39;t have a solution yet. Solutions that are missing that little something to make them amazing. These are our wishes for the next year.</p><p>我们从还没有解决方案的远程团队那里听说过这样的问题。解决方案缺少让它们变得令人惊叹的小东西。这是我们对来年的祝福。</p><p>      Running an internationally distributed team has a lot of challenges to overcome, but the most rigid of them all are international regulations and specializations when it comes to running a multi-national organization.</p><p>管理一个国际分布的团队有很多挑战需要克服，但当涉及到管理一个多国组织时，最严格的挑战都是国际法规和专业化。</p><p>  The operations side of remote work is usually deemed pretty unsexy. It&#39;s all about working with regulators, shaking hands and most likely an expensive journey to expand in a lot of countries. Hard work, but one that wouldn&#39;t go unappreciated.</p><p>远程工作的运营方面通常被认为相当乏味。这一切都是关于与监管机构合作，握手，很可能是一次昂贵的在许多国家扩张的旅程。努力工作，但不会不被赏识。</p><p>      For how far we&#39;ve come with remote work, we really haven&#39;t made a ton of strides with cross-continental payments. In my first-ever remote job, I used to get paid from a regular US corporate bank account directly to my swiss bank account. Payments got routed wrongly here and there, the fees were sky-high and the payments often took a week to get to me.</p><p>至于我们在远程工作方面已经走了多远，我们在跨洲支付方面真的没有取得很大进展。在我的第一份远程工作中，我过去常常从一个普通的美国公司银行账户直接拿到我的瑞士银行账户的工资。付款到处都是错误的，费用很高，付款通常需要一周的时间才能到我手中。</p><p>  Since then, we&#39;ve made a stride or two. With something like  TransferWise, you can make the whole process a little bit speedier and cheaper. Transfers now only take 1-2 working days and are fairly transparent. Even better: Fees and availability aren&#39;t confined to one nation, TransferWise is almost available anywhere.</p><p>从那时起，我们已经大踏步前进了一两步。使用TransferWise这样的工具，您可以使整个过程更快、更便宜。现在转账只需要1-2个工作日，而且相当透明。更好的是：费用和可获得性并不局限于一个国家，TransferWise几乎在任何地方都可以获得。</p><p>  Then, there are online wallets like Venmo and PayPal. They are really handy to guarantee instant transfers at a cheap price and are very handy for folks that are unbanked. Skipping the dusty banking infrastructure? All for it!</p><p>然后，还有像Venmo和PayPal这样的在线钱包。它们真的很方便，可以保证以低廉的价格进行即时转账，而且对于没有银行账户的人来说也非常方便。跳过尘土飞扬的银行基础设施？完全同意!。</p><p>  And then, of course, there&#39;s cryptocurrency. Now, Bitcoin &amp; co. were never meant to become investment instruments. In the past year, I asked to get paid for something through crypto twice. The payments were instant, extremely cheap ( I paid around $0.001 in fees) and my bank didn&#39;t ask me about that weird big-money-transfer from the US. Now, if it only was easier to access.</p><p>当然，还有加密货币。现在，比特币&Amp；Co。从来没有打算成为投资工具。在过去的一年里，我两次要求通过密码支付某些东西的费用。这些付款是即时的，非常便宜(我支付了大约0.001美元的手续费)，我的银行也没有问我关于从美国进行的那笔奇怪的大额转账的事情。现在，如果它更容易接近就好了。</p><p>        So, how does the payment gateway of the future look like? Well, first of all, it should be accessible. Too many financial services are confined to the US, Canada and the UK. It should also be internationally receivable. While a bank transfer almost goes anywhere, I&#39;ve heard multiple times now that people would prefer not getting foreign direct-to-bank payments to accounts in India, for example. The remote payment stack accounts for that.</p><p>那么，未来的支付网关是什么样子呢？嗯，首先，它应该是可以接近的。太多的金融服务仅限于美国、加拿大和英国。它也应该是国际收款。例如，虽然银行转账几乎可以到任何地方，但我现在已经多次听说，人们宁愿不接受外国直接向银行付款，也不愿在印度开立账户。远程支付堆栈说明了这一点。</p><p>  Finally, waiting for your pay stub and then the money a couple of days later really doesn&#39;t fit in the internet age anymore.  Maybe you can leverage cryptocurrency and existing infrastructure to create something instant, simple and internationally accessible?</p><p>最后，等待你的工资存根，然后在几天后拿到钱，真的不再适合互联网时代了。也许你可以利用加密货币和现有的基础设施来创造一些即时、简单和国际上可以访问的东西？</p><p>      When it comes to retirement benefits, many remote companies don&#39;t take it 100% seriously just yet and according to the latest surveys, employees don&#39;t mind either. With work-life balance as a commonly cited benefit, being remote in itself is an amazing perk. People are happy to take a pay cut or even let go of their retirement benefits.</p><p>谈到退休福利，许多偏远公司还没有百分之百认真对待，根据最新的调查，员工也不介意。由于工作与生活的平衡是人们经常提到的好处，远离工作本身就是一项令人惊叹的福利。人们乐于接受减薪，甚至放弃退休福利。</p><p>  Even if a company is  open to having a 401k, doing it the &#34;right&#34; away is almost impossible with every country having its own system. From the  Pensionskasse in Germany to the  EPS in Japan, countries run their own systems that are usually not accessible to foreign entities.</p><p>即使一家公司对拥有401K；持开放态度，但由于每个国家都有自己的体系，要做到这一点几乎是不可能的。从德国的养老金计划(Pensionskasse)到日本的每股收益计划(EPS)，各国都运行着自己的系统，外国实体通常无法访问这些系统。</p><p>  This might not seem important at first, but according to  researchers at MIT and multiple financial advisories, taking part in and maxing out 401k accounts (and subsequent alternatives in other countries) is a cornerstone to building life-changing wealth. For all personal finance lovers out there, not having that option may be a dealbreaker. Offering 401k and other retirement benefits is about to get a lot more important.</p><p>起初，这似乎并不重要，但根据麻省理工学院(MIT)和多家金融咨询公司的研究人员的说法，参与并充实401K账户(以及其他国家随后的替代账户)是积累改变人生的财富的基石。对于所有的个人理财爱好者来说，没有这个选择可能会破坏交易。提供401K和其他退休福利将变得更加重要。</p><p>  Our idea:  What can a private company build within the regulations that allows for true, employer-matched and internationally available retirement accounts? Piggy-back off existing infrastructure and regulations? Sell gold bars and store them in a few storage units? Some sort of e-insurance? Again, cryptocurrency? We&#39;d love to hear ideas.</p><p>我们的想法是：一家私营公司可以在法规范围内建立什么，以便提供真实的、与雇主匹配的、可在国际上获得的退休账户？利用现有的基础设施和法规？卖掉金条，然后把它们存放在几个储藏室里？某种电子保险？再说一遍，加密货币？我们喜欢听取意见。</p><p>      For most remote companies, &#34;perks&#34; and &#34;benefits&#34; under the hood only mean a bit more money. In all remote jobs I&#39;ve had so far, I&#39;ve claimed my perk payouts as part of my regular salary payout. That means additional taxable income, not what perks are about.</p><p>对于大多数偏远公司来说，幕后福利和福利只是意味着多一点钱。到目前为止，在我做过的所有远程工作中，我都把我的津贴作为定期工资支出的一部分。这意味着额外的应税收入，而不是什么津贴。</p><p>  Let me explain. A few years ago, my friend got hired at a very generous company local to us. He got a generous salary but was additionally able to lease a car through the company, set up a subscription for lunch delivery and for a while was even able to rent a room out of the company&#39;s real estate arm. The costs of that were deducted directly from his salary. As a result of that, he paid a few $1,000 less in taxes than in the previous years.</p><p>听我解释。几年前，我的朋友受雇于我们当地一家非常慷慨的公司。他拿到了一份丰厚的薪水，但还可以通过公司租车，订阅午餐外卖服务，有一段时间甚至可以从公司的房地产部门租到一个房间。那笔费用直接从他的工资中扣除了。因此，他比前几年少交了1000美元的税款。</p><p>  Many of those perks – from a company car to new Macbook – are much easier to reimburse in cash for remote companies, so no pre-tax perks at all.  As a potential new service, what can you do to make this happen?</p><p>许多津贴-从公司的汽车到新的Macbook-对偏远公司来说更容易用现金报销，所以根本没有税前津贴。作为一项潜在的新服务，您可以做些什么来实现这一点？</p><p>  One option is to hire through one of the many  EOR services that specialize in providing a full-service. For many companies that already have their payroll in order, that&#39;s not interesting though. You could save people multiple $1,000s in taxes here, so it&#39;s a service you don&#39;t have to sell for cheap.</p><p>一种选择是通过许多专门提供全面服务的提高采收率服务中的一项进行招聘。不过，对于许多已经有了工资单的公司来说，这并不有趣。在这里，你可以为人们节省上千美元的税金，所以这是一项你不必低价出售的服务。</p><p>      Communication is still the king of all remote tools. Out of the many tools we&#39;ve seen this year, probably 2/3 were in the communication and collaboration space of some sort. So, what gaps are supposed to still be there? Let&#39;s walk through it.</p><p>通信仍然是所有远程工具中的王道。在我们今年看到的众多工具中，可能有2/3是在某种形式的交流和协作领域。那么，还有哪些差距应该还存在呢？让我们从头到尾看一遍。</p><p>      I believe meetings are largely figured out. This year, we&#39;ve seen some iterations on the traditional meeting experience, but most of them are a minor improvement for teams that have an amazing product-fit. One thing that isn&#39;t solved yet is large, moderated all-hands meetings.</p><p>我相信会议在很大程度上已经解决了。今年，我们看到了一些对传统会议体验的迭代，但对于拥有令人惊叹的产品匹配的团队来说，其中大多数都是一个微小的改进。有一件事还没有解决，那就是大型的、有节制的全体人员会议。</p><p>  All-hands meetings are meetings that include all, or at least most of the company in the same meeting. The meeting experience is fundamentally different from your standard small group meeting: The speaker is in focus and other participants rarely speak.</p><p>全体会议是指在同一次会议中包括所有人，或者至少包括公司大部分人的会议。会议体验与标准的小组会议有根本的不同：演讲者聚焦，其他参与者很少发言。</p><p>  The relationship between speaker and listener is quite clear – one speaker, many participants (often over 100) that should be able to speak when called to do so but not otherwise. The experience of such meetings has improved with new meeting software, compared to teams that had to make-do with Skype &amp; co., but it&#39;s still not seamless.</p><p>说话者和听话者之间的关系非常清楚-一个发言者，许多参与者(通常超过100人)应该能够在被要求发言时这样做，但不能在其他情况下这样做。与只能凑合使用Skype&amp；公司的团队相比，新的会议软件改善了此类会议的体验，但仍然不是无缝的。</p><p>    &#34;At some point, to have everyone on a Skype call for an all-hands meeting, we would have two laptops set up next to each other and have one laptop call half the company and the other laptop call the other half of the company. That was nonsense 😄&#34;</p><p>在某个时候，为了让所有人都通过Skype通话召开全体会议，我们会将两台笔记本电脑放在一起，一台笔记本电脑呼叫一半的公司，另一台笔记本电脑呼叫公司的另一半。那是胡说八道，😄&#34；</p><p>      The last time I had an all-hands meeting on Zoom, things didn&#39;t go great. Some people called in and were unable to mute themselves. People tried to ask questions but got interrupted by either the speaker or another person in the audience.</p><p>上一次我在Zoom上召开全体会议时，事情并不顺利。一些人打电话进来，无法使自己静音。人们试图提问，但被演讲者或听众中的另一个人打断了。</p><p>  With over 100 participants, latency was all over the place and the worst part – the meeting host had a disconnect at some point in the meeting and while the room was able to continue, the recording stopped there. A third of the team was not able to re-play the meeting.</p><p>有100多名与会者，延迟无处不在，最糟糕的是-会议主持人在会议的某个时候断开了连接，当会议室能够继续时，录音就停止了。团队中有三分之一的人无法重播会议。</p><p>  I believe all-hands meetings warrant a new piece of tech that is rarely used – probably only for larger talks and announcements once a month – but works for that type of meeting every single time, including server-side recording, low latency, speaking requests and a larger range of moderation features.</p><p>我相信全体会议需要一种新的技术，这种技术很少使用-可能只在每月一次的较大规模的演讲和公告中使用-但每次都适用于这种类型的会议，包括服务器端录音、低延迟、发言请求和更广泛的主持功能。</p><p>      Communication and writing skills have been essential requirements for modern remote teams that largely rely on sparse and long-form communication. Many talented people struggle with that, are either not used or accommodated to typing a lot of simply prefer the face-to-face way of doing things.</p><p>沟通和写作技能一直是现代远程团队的基本要求，这些团队在很大程度上依赖于稀疏和长形式的通信。许多有才华的人为此而苦苦挣扎，要么不习惯或不适应打字，要么就是更喜欢面对面的方式做事。</p><p>  Just like we build our knowledge worker&#39;s skills using education stipends, conferences, courses and books, we should also start looking into active communication training.</p><p>就像我们通过教育津贴、会议、课程和书籍来培养知识型员工的技能一样，我们也应该开始考虑积极的沟通培训。</p><p>  In the past, I have benefitted from coaching a lot in my career. Coaches have helped me push through some tough professional issues and have helped me build a small successful business. In the future, coaching will not only be interesting for hard skills but possibly even more soft skills. Getting continuous training in communication and writing will be popular with goal-getters and teams alike.</p><p>过去，在我的职业生涯中，我从执教中获益良多。教练们帮助我解决了一些棘手的职业问题，并帮助我建立了一个成功的小企业。在未来，教练不仅会对硬技能感兴趣，而且可能会有更多的软技能。在沟通和写作方面接受持续的训练将会受到有目标的人和团队的欢迎。</p><p>  Now, I&#39;m not necessarily advocating for plain and simple writing training.  Grammarly has put an automated writing coach in many author&#39;s pockets, but what if you could push that further? Remind you that you didn&#39;t give a status update in a while? Notifying you if your text lacks some context or reads passive-aggressive. Grammarly works great, even as I am writing this post, but it&#39;s not an end-to-end communication coach, just an integral part of it.  We&#39;d love to see something new in that space.</p><p>现在，我并不一定主张简单明了的写作训练。Grammarly已经在许多作家的口袋里放了一个自动化写作教练，但如果你能进一步推动这一点呢？提醒您您已经有一段时间没有更新状态了吗？如果你的文本缺少上下文或者读起来是被动攻击性的，就会通知你。Grammarly效果很好，即使在我写这篇文章的时候也是如此，但它不是一个端到端的沟通教练，只是它不可或缺的一部分。我们希望在那个领域看到一些新的东西。</p><p>      A consistent piece of feedback we&#39;ve gotten this year is that teams struggle to find a good way to brainstorm new innovations. Remote work is amazing to get into a deep state, collect some thoughts and find new ideas, but when it comes to collaboration and getting those thoughts out, it gets more difficult.</p><p>我们今年得到的一致反馈是，团队很难找到一种好方法来集思广益，进行新的创新。远程工作对于深入工作状态、收集一些想法和发现新想法是令人惊叹的，但当涉及到协作和将这些想法释放出来时，就会变得更加困难。</p><p>  The way we&#39;ve learned to brainstorm in the professional world is using visualizations. We like to draw mind maps or sketch graphs on a whiteboard. Filling out the blank space can indeed yield new ideas and has helped really innovative teams come up with amazing ideas.</p><p>我们学会了在专业领域进行头脑风暴的方式就是使用可视化。我们喜欢在白板上画思维导图或草图。填补空白确实可以产生新的想法，并帮助真正创新的团队想出令人惊叹的想法。</p><p>        The options we have to do so across the globe are not always fitting to what we need. We have digital whiteboards that allow people to collaborate on a combined white space, there are collaborative drawing areas and writing platforms but what often happens is that with things being more asynchronously and online, we tend to lose context.</p><p>我们必须在全球范围内这样做的选择并不总是符合我们的需要。我们有数字白板，允许人们在组合的空白空间上协作，有协作的绘图区和写作平台，但经常发生的是，随着事情变得更加异步和在线，我们往往会失去上下文。</p><p>  Think about this – how can you yield ideas without the other person being online? Maybe drawings that are attached to audio messages? An entirely new framework? An app for the iPad that allows you to quickly jot down ideas on a shared space during a call?</p><p>想想看--没有其他人在线，你怎么能想出点子呢？也许是附加在音频信息上的图画？一个全新的框架？IPad上的一款应用程序，可以让你在通话过程中快速地在共享空间上记下想法？</p><p>  I believe this is a very interesting space to be in and there&#39;s definitely not just one solution.</p><p>我相信这是一个非常有趣的领域，而且绝对不只有一个解决方案。</p><p>      The recruiting benefits of remote work are undisputed. Remote teams have access to bigger and better hiring pools. People that get hired remotely are trained to be more self-directed and are retained for a lot longer. Despite all of that, hiring for a remote team is hard and the signal-noise ratio isn&#39;t always the best. Once people are hired, not everyone is made for the remote-first lifestyle, let&#39;s solve that!</p><p>远程工作的招聘好处是毋庸置疑的。远程团队可以获得更大、更好的招聘资源。远程受雇的人被训练成更具自主性，并且被留任的时间要长得多。尽管如此，招聘偏远团队是很困难的，而且信噪比并不总是最好的。一旦雇用了员工，并不是每个人都适合远程优先的生活方式，让我们来解决这个问题吧！</p><p>      Life coaching has been a thing for decades and high-profile experts have referenced good coaches as one of the reasons for their success. As we all know though, most of it is nonsense. Plenty of people without other tangible skills are looking to make a living off suggesting a certain lifestyle and most commonly sell some courses, supplements and other programs alongside it.</p><p>几十年来，生活教练一直是一件事，知名专家都提到优秀的教练是他们成功的原因之一。然而，正如我们都知道的那样，大部分都是胡说八道。许多没有其他有形技能的人都在寻求通过建议某种生活方式谋生，最常见的是同时出售一些课程、补充剂和其他项目。</p><p>  However, there  are professional life coaches out there. Company founders, executives and other high-profile public figures use a range of coaches to keep their mind and body in balance. CEO coaches are often used to build better leadership skills and plenty of startup founders are using coaches to push through the stressful venture life.</p><p>然而，外面也有专业的生活教练。公司创始人、高管和其他知名公众人物使用一系列教练来保持他们的身心平衡。CEO教练通常被用来培养更好的领导技能，很多初创公司的创始人都在利用教练来推动充满压力的风险生活。</p><p>  When I talk to new remote employees, especially now in the time of Covid-19, people are often lost. More than once I&#39;ve heard a statement along these lines:</p><p>当我和新的远程员工交谈时，特别是现在的新冠肺炎时代，人们经常会迷失。我不止一次听到这样的说法：</p><p>    &#34;Working from home has been great for a couple of weeks, but now I&#39;m tired and I tend to get migraines every day.&#34;</p><p>几周来，在家工作一直很棒，但现在我很累，而且每天都会偏头痛。</p><p>  &#34;I can&#39;t get out of bed in the morning. Working from home has been great, but disconnecting is a struggle.&#34;</p><p>我早上起不来床。在家工作很棒，但切断联系是一件很艰难的事情。</p><p>      Becoming a remote worker is a drastic lifestyle change. Suddenly, there&#39;s no commute to catch early in the morning. No need to get your best pants and shirt out. If you let things slip for too long, suddenly there&#39;s no reason to leave the house, get a healthy lunch or shower anymore either. It&#39;s a slippery slope.</p><p>成为一名远程工作者是生活方式的巨大改变。突然之间，一大早就没有通勤可赶了。没必要把你最好的裤子和衬衫拿出来。如果你让事情拖延太久，突然之间，你也就没有理由离开房子，吃一顿健康的午餐，或者洗澡了。这是一个很滑的斜坡。</p><p>  The bigger is the need for company-provided life coaches for remote workers. Again, this can either be a human or a digital assistant that connects to your Fitbit or Apple Watch, but the key point is that new remote workers are staying accountable to themselves.</p><p>更大的需求是公司为远程员工提供的生活教练。同样，这可以是连接到您的Fitbit或Apple Watch的人或数字助理，但关键是新的远程工作人员对自己负责。</p><p>      A few months ago, I shared a fully remote part-time support role for my  business in a few Facebook groups. I don&#39;t log in to Facebook often, so when I came back after a couple of days I had over 300 applications in my inbox already and they kept coming until I deleted the posts. I can only imagine what&#39;d happen for a highly visible full-time role!</p><p>几个月前，我在Facebook的几个群里分享了一个完全远程兼职支持我的企业的角色。我不经常登录Facebook，所以当我几天后回来时，我的收件箱里已经有300多份申请了，它们一直在源源不断地出现，直到我删除了这些帖子。我只能想象对于一个高知名度的全职角色会发生什么！</p><p>  The worst part is that most profiles are pretty generic. The same CV office word layout over and over. Some a bit better executed than others. I went through multiple cycles of &#34;first-level recruiting&#34; to just bring down the sheer number of resumés.</p><p>最糟糕的是，大多数配置文件都是相当通用的。一遍又一遍地使用相同的简历、办公用字版面。一些人比另一些人执行得更好一些。为了减少简历的绝对数量，我经历了多个一级招聘周期。</p><p>  First, I deleted all that didn&#39;t send a proper CV. Second, I got rid of applications that didn&#39;t follow the (really, really) simple instructions. I asked for salary expectations, availability and timeframe. From plenty of people, I got empty emails with a CV attached, so I removed those.</p><p>首先，我删除了所有没有发送合适简历的内容。其次，我剔除了那些不遵循(真的，真的)简单说明的应用程序。我询问了他们对薪水的期望、可获得性和时间表。从很多人那里，我收到了附有简历的空电子邮件，所以我把它们删除了。</p><p>        That brought the CV count down to around 60 or 70. Finally, I was able to take a look at the CVs, see their experience and go over their reply. Be it because of mismatched salary expectations or lack of relevant skills in the space, I ended up with about 20 profiles I was able to look at more seriously.</p><p>这使得简历数量降至60或70份左右。最后，我看了一下简历，看了看他们的经历，看了一遍他们的回复。不管是因为薪资期望不匹配，还是因为该领域缺乏相关技能，我最终得到了大约20份我可以更认真地查看的个人资料。</p><p>  The process took me a few hours and is usually wrapped up as &#34;first-level hiring&#34;, everything that happens before you take a serious look at the CV and start doing interviews. It took a few hours I could have used for a better cause.</p><p>这个过程花了我几个小时，通常是在你认真看简历和开始面试之前完成的第一级招聘。花了几个小时我本可以用来做更好的事。</p><p>  That&#39;s exactly why I think it&#39;s a good space for a company to build in. Big remote businesses are regularly getting over 1,000 applications per position and north of 80% of them can immediately get disqualified.
