Confined within an fMRI machine in the basement of a research hospital in Baltimore, with a mask over my eyes and the countdown crackling through my earbuds, I felt as if I were an astronaut about to blast into orbit. But where I was headed was far stranger than space.</p><p>我从基本现实中记得的最后一件事是一个研究人员倒数到零的声音。在巴尔的摩一家研究医院的地下室里，我被关在一台功能核磁共振成像仪里，戴着面具，耳塞里响起倒计时的声音，我感觉自己就像一个即将被送入轨道的宇航员。但是我要去的地方比太空要奇怪得多。</p><p> I had lent my gray matter to researchers at Johns Hopkins University for the first imaging study of what your brain does on salvinorin A, a potent, naturally occurring psychedelic produced by a plant called  salvia divinorum. I was lying inside a machine that would use massive magnets to peer into my brain, and, as I  reported on my experience with the study in 2019, I had just inhaled an unspecified dose of the pure crystalline substance from a hose attached to what one of the researchers characterized as an “FDA-approved crack pipe.” Over the course of an hour, I was given two doses—one placebo, one salvinorin—but I hadn’t been told in advance which was which. I hadn’t felt anything from the first dose, which meant that this time, once the researcher reached zero, I would start feeling the drug&#39;s powerful effects.</p><p>我把我的灰质借给了约翰·霍普金斯大学的研究人员，用于第一次对大脑对丹参甲素的作用进行成像研究。丹参甲素是一种天然产生的强效迷幻剂，由一种名为丹参的植物产生。我躺在一台机器里，这台机器将使用巨大的磁铁来窥视我的大脑，正如我在2019年报告的这项研究的经验一样，我刚刚从一根软管上吸入了一种剂量不详的纯晶体物质，软管连接着一名研究人员所说的“FDA批准的裂解管”。在一个小时的过程中，我被给了两剂-一剂安慰剂，一剂沙维诺林-但我事先没有被告知哪一种是哪一种。我在第一次注射时没有感觉到任何东西，这意味着这一次，一旦研究人员达到零，我就会开始感受到这种药物的强大效果。</p><p> I knew what I was getting into. I had done a trial run the day before, lying on a couch in a laboratory that was furnished to look like a tastefully trippy living room. During that experience, I had felt my physical self disintegrate as a stunning diamond pattern began rolling from both sides of my face toward a boundless horizon. Any sense of self washed away and time became a meaningless abstraction. I was pure existence having an encounter with the infinite.</p><p>我知道我要面对的是什么。前一天，我做了一次试运行，躺在实验室的沙发上，实验室的家具看起来就像一个雅致的迷幻起居室。在那次经历中，当一个令人惊叹的钻石图案开始从我的脸两侧滚向无边无际的地平线时，我感觉到我的身体自我瓦解了。任何自我意识都被冲走了，时间变成了毫无意义的抽象。我是纯粹的存在，与无限相遇。</p><p>  My psychedelic experience in the fMRI machine was markedly less otherworldly. On the second round, I saw some colorful pinwheels and felt as though my body had merged with the machine. But I didn’t enter another dimension or dissolve into pure being. This may have been because I received a lower dose. Or it may have been because it’s harder to give in to the experience when you’re inside a giant machine making a racket while it soaks your head in a powerful magnetic field.</p><p>我在fMRI机器上的迷幻体验明显没有那么超凡脱俗。在第二轮，我看到了一些五颜六色的风车，感觉我的身体好像已经和机器融为一体了。但我并没有进入另一个维度，也没有融入到纯粹的存在中。这可能是因为我接受的剂量较低。或者，这可能是因为当你在一台巨大的机器里制造球拍，而它将你的头浸泡在强大的磁场中时，你很难屈服于这种体验。</p><p> But I wasn’t here to touch the face of God. The point was to allow the researchers to watch my brain and those of the 11 other volunteers in the study on salvia. The team was led by Manoj Doss, a postdoctoral researcher in neuropharmacology at Johns Hopkins University working under the guidance of the veteran psychedelic scientist Roland Griffiths. A decade earlier, Griffiths had orchestrated the  first controlled study of the subjective effects of salvinorin A. To get a better understanding of how the drug produces its incredibly strong psychedelic effects and whether it might have any clinical relevance for treating conditions like depression or drug addiction, they needed to see what was happening at the neural level. So I got high … for science.</p><p>但我不是来这里触摸上帝的脸的。这样做的目的是让研究人员观察我和其他11名参与鼠尾草研究的志愿者的大脑。该团队由马诺伊·多斯(Manoj Doss)领导，他是约翰·霍普金斯大学(Johns Hopkins University)神经药理学的博士后研究员，在资深迷幻科学家罗兰·格里菲斯(Roland Griffiths)的指导下工作。十年前，格里菲斯策划了第一项关于萨尔维诺菌素A的主观效应的对照研究。为了更好地了解该药物是如何产生令人难以置信的强烈迷幻作用的，以及它是否与治疗抑郁症或药物成瘾等疾病有临床相关性，他们需要观察神经层面的情况。所以我的…很高。为了科学。</p><p>  Last week, the team published the results of the study in   Scientific Reports, detailing what they saw in our brains as we tripped. The most prominent effect seen in all 12 subjects was a significant decrease in the synchrony of the default mode network. This network is a mesh of brain regions that is primarily associated with internal thoughts but also plays a role in memory and emotion. It’s activated when we’re thinking about ourselves and others or orienting ourselves in space and time. Different regions of the brain will show increased activity when we focus on a specific task outside of ourselves, like reading or playing an instrument, but the default mode network is what pops back on when we turn our attention back on ourselves.</p><p>上周，研究小组在“科学报告”上发表了这项研究的结果，详细描述了我们绊倒时在大脑中看到的情况。在所有12名受试者中看到的最显著的影响是默认模式网络的同步性显著降低。这个网络是大脑区域的网状结构，主要与内部思想有关，但也在记忆和情感方面发挥作用。当我们思考自己和他人，或者在空间和时间中定位自己时，它就会被激活。当我们专注于外部的特定任务时，大脑的不同区域会显示出更多的活动，比如阅读或演奏乐器，但当我们将注意力重新转移到自己身上时，默认模式网络就会弹回。</p><p>  When your attention turns inward, the communication between the brain regions in the default mode network syncs up like musicians in an orchestra. Other fMRI studies of volunteers high on better known psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin, the psychoactive molecule in mushrooms, have also shown decreases in coupling among the areas involved in this network. It’s as if the musicians in the orchestra stop following a central conductor and each start keeping time with separate metronomes. Some researchers think that the decreased activity between these network connections is part of the essence of what makes psychedelic drugs so  psychedelic.</p><p>当你的注意力转向内部时，默认模式网络中大脑区域之间的交流就会同步，就像管弦乐队中的音乐家一样。其他对志愿者进行的fmri研究也显示，这个网络中涉及的区域之间的耦合度降低了。这些志愿者服用了更知名的迷幻剂，如迷幻剂和蘑菇中的精神活性分子裸盖菇素(Psilocybin)。这就好像交响乐团中的音乐家不再跟随中央指挥，每个人都开始用不同的节拍来保持节拍。一些研究人员认为，这些网络连接之间的活动减少是迷幻药物如此迷幻的本质的一部分。</p><p>  But the Johns Hopkins researchers think this is not the whole story. “Research on classic psychedelic drugs like LSD, psilocybin, and DMT has been focusing on the default mode network because it has been hijacked by a Freudian narrative that requires a concrete ‘ego,’” says Doss, referring to the psychoanalytic concept of self. This, he says, has caused researchers to focus less attention on changes in activity elsewhere in the brain, even though those changes are often larger than in the default mode network. Moreover, non-psychedelic drugs including cannabis and alcohol also cause decreases in default brain network activity, which complicates the idea that it might be the root of a psychedelic experience.</p><p>但约翰·霍普金斯大学的研究人员认为，这并不是全部情况。“对LSD、psilocybin和DMT等经典迷幻药物的研究一直集中在默认模式网络上，因为它被一种需要具体‘自我’的弗洛伊德叙事所劫持，”多斯说，他指的是精神分析中的自我概念。他说，这导致研究人员较少关注大脑其他部位活动的变化，尽管这些变化通常比默认模式下的网络更大。此外，包括大麻和酒精在内的非迷幻药物也会导致默认的大脑网络活动减少，这让人们更加复杂地认为这可能是</p><p> The fact that salvinorin A selectively targets the network only adds to the confusion, because it’s so different from classic psychedelics in most other respects. Perhaps the biggest difference is that while most psychedelics primarily act on serotonin receptors, salvinorin A acts on the kappa opioid receptor, which seems to play a role in regulating pain and modulating the effects of common opioids like morphine and fentanyl. “Salvinorin A is unique as a kappa-opioid agonist that has psychedelic-like effects, and this calls into question whether reduced default mode network connectivity is really a specific mechanism of ‘classic’ psychedelic drugs,” says Fred Barrett, a neuroscientist at Johns Hopkins and a coauthor of the study.</p><p>萨尔维诺林A选择性地针对网络的事实只会增加混乱，因为它在大多数其他方面与经典的迷幻药非常不同。也许最大的不同之处在于，虽然大多数迷幻剂主要作用于血清素受体，但salvinorin A作用于kappa阿片受体，后者似乎在调节疼痛和调节常见阿片类药物(如吗啡和芬太尼)的效果方面发挥作用。约翰·霍普金斯大学(Johns Hopkins)神经科学家、该研究的合著者弗雷德·巴雷特(Fred Barrett)说：“萨尔维诺林A作为一种具有迷幻样作用的kappa类阿片激动剂是独一无二的，这让人怀疑，降低默认模式的网络连通性是否真的是‘经典’迷幻药物的一种特定机制。”</p><p> In other words, what’s interesting about the team’s results is that they seem to show that salvinorin A  isn’t special among psychedelics when it comes to decreasing activity in the default mode network. It’s an atypical psychedelic in pretty much every way, yet its neurological effects are stronger in the brain network that many researchers think are key to experiencing the effects of classic psychedelic drugs than those drugs themselves. “Considering salvinorin A has subjective effects quite different from classic psychedelics, it certainly doesn&#39;t bode well for the idea that the default mode network is key to their effects,” says Doss.</p><p>换句话说，研究小组的结果有趣之处在于，他们似乎表明，当涉及到减少默认模式网络中的活动时，Salvinorin A在迷幻剂中并不是特别的。它在几乎所有方面都是一种非典型的迷幻剂，但它在大脑网络中的神经效应更强，许多研究人员认为，大脑网络是体验经典迷幻药物效果的关键，而不是那些药物本身。多斯说：“考虑到萨尔维诺林A与经典迷幻药有很大不同的主观效果，这肯定不是一个好兆头，因为默认模式网络是它们效果的关键。”</p><p> The molecule is produced naturally in salvia divinorum, a type of sage in the mint family. The plant is endemic to southern Mexico, where it has been ingested ritualistically by indigenous peoples for centuries. But it wasn’t introduced to researchers in the United States until 1962, when Harvard botanist Gordon Wasson  described its psychoactive effects and botanical classification. It took another 20 years before scientists isolated its primary psychoactive ingredient.</p><p>这种分子是在鼠尾草中自然产生的，鼠尾草是薄荷家族的一种鼠尾草。这种植物是墨西哥南部特有的，几个世纪以来，那里的土著人民一直按照仪式摄取它。但直到1962年，哈佛大学植物学家戈登·瓦森(Gordon Wasson)描述了它的精神活性作用和植物学分类，它才被引入美国的研究人员。科学家又花了20年的时间才分离出它的主要精神活性成分。</p><p> “Salvinorin A challenges our conception of what psychedelics are,” says Peter Addy, a psychotherapist who has done extensive research on the subjective effects of salvia while working at Yale and wasn’t involved with the Johns Hopkins study. “It’s the only psychoactive substance that is more potent than LSD. Taking an incredibly small amount of salvinorin A produces an incredibly large effect in consciousness.”</p><p>“萨尔维诺林A挑战了我们对迷幻药的概念，”心理治疗师彼得·阿迪(Peter Addy)说，他在耶鲁工作期间对丹参的主观影响进行了广泛的研究，并未参与约翰·霍普金斯大学的研究。“它是唯一一种比LSD更有效的精神活性物质。服用极少量的丹参素A会对意识产生令人难以置信的巨大影响。“。</p><p> Part of the reason for the scientific establishment’s neglect of salvinorin A may have to do with how many people find its effects deeply unpleasant. Compared to LSD and psilocybin, which became emblematic of the 1960s feel-good mindset, salvinorin A comes on fast and can make a person feel like they’ve left their body, which has probably turned many people off from using it recreationally. Indeed, it’s one of the few well-known psychedelics that isn’t a federally controlled substance under Drug Enforcement Administration regulations, although its use is outlawed in several states.</p><p>科学机构忽视萨尔维诺甲素的部分原因可能与有多少人发现它的效果非常令人不快有关。与LSD和裸盖菇素(它们成为20世纪60年代感觉良好心态的象征)相比，salvinorin A来得很快，能让人感觉自己已经离开了身体，这可能已经让许多人不再娱乐地使用它。事实上，它是为数不多的几种众所周知的迷幻剂之一，根据药品监督管理局的规定，它不是联邦管制的物质，尽管它的使用在几个州是非法的。</p><p>  Most of the state laws prohibiting the use of salvinorin A were passed in the mid-2000s after videos of teenagers smoking salvia and going catatonic or losing control of their behaviors and emotions  began circulating on the web. This attracted the attention of lawmakers and concerned parents, who sought to ban the substance by comparing it to LSD and other psychedelics. In some states it was the  pushback from psychedelic researchers like Addy and Matthew Johnson, a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University, that saved the drug from being outlawed. These researchers were concerned that scheduling salvia would make it prohibitively difficult to study its potential therapeutic uses; the fact that salvinorin A acts on an opioid receptor has led some researchers to experiment with it as the basis for a nonaddictive  pain management alternative,  treatment for cocaine addiction, or  an antidepressant.</p><p>大多数禁止使用salvinorin A的州法律都是在2000年代中期通过的，当时青少年吸烟鼠尾草、精神紧张或行为和情绪失控的视频开始在网络上流传。这引起了立法者和忧心忡忡的家长的注意，他们试图通过将其与LSD和其他迷幻剂进行比较来禁止这种物质。在一些州，正是艾迪和约翰·霍普金斯大学精神病学家马修·约翰逊(Matthew Johnson)等迷幻研究人员的阻挠，才使这种药物免于被取缔。这些研究人员担心，安排丹参的时间表会让研究它的潜在治疗用途变得极其困难；萨尔维诺林A作用于阿片受体的事实促使一些研究人员将其作为非成瘾性疼痛管理替代方案、可卡因成瘾治疗或抗抑郁药的基础进行实验。</p><p> So far, however, the only evidence for the potential medicinal uses of salvinorin A and  related drug analogs is in a limited number of animal studies. Despite some positive results in reducing  depressive symptoms and  increasing pain tolerance in rats, a lot of work needs to be done before much can be said about any possible medicinal benefits for humans. Doss, for one, isn’t holding his breath. “I don&#39;t know if I believe that a kappa opioid agonist is going to be important for the treatment of something like depression or addiction,” he says. “There are not enough reports yet in people. If we believe this activity might be important for the improvement of depression, let’s start running clinical trials.”</p><p>然而，到目前为止，关于萨尔维甲素A和相关药物类似物潜在药用的唯一证据是在有限数量的动物研究中。尽管在减轻抑郁症状和提高大鼠对疼痛的耐受性方面取得了一些积极的结果，但在对人类可能产生的任何医疗益处做出更多评价之前，还需要做大量的工作。道斯就是其中之一，他没有屏住呼吸。他说：“我不知道我是否相信卡帕类阿片激动剂对抑郁症或成瘾等疾病的治疗会很重要。”“人们对此的报道还不够多。如果我们认为这项活动可能对改善抑郁症很重要，那我们就开始进行临床试验吧。“。</p><p>  The brain imaging study at Johns Hopkins was a first step toward understanding the effects of this bizarre psychedelic. Doss says the study was hampered by several limitations, such as its small sample size and the lack of repeat trials, but it points the way to more comprehensive studies. To get a better handle on what salvia is doing in the brain, in future studies Doss would want to image the brains of individuals on salvia at multiple doses—and cross reference those patterns to the ways their brains behave on classic psychedelics. He says it would also be interesting to compare how people perform tasks while taking salvinorin A versus other psychedelics, rather than just lying still in an fMRI machine, which would help differentiate its effects on specific regions of the brain.</p><p>约翰霍普金斯大学的脑成像研究是了解这种奇异迷幻剂的效果的第一步。多斯说，这项研究受到几个限制的阻碍，比如样本量小，缺乏重复试验，但它为更全面的研究指明了方向。为了更好地掌握丹参在大脑中的作用，在未来的研究中，Doss将希望对服用丹参的个体的大脑进行多剂量成像-并将这些模式交叉引用到</p><p> For now, though, salvinorin A remains as mysterious as ever, underscoring how much we have to learn about psychedelics. “There&#39;s a lot of information out there on how the brain produces thoughts and behaviors, but much of that is being ignored in psychedelic research,” says Doss. “Instead, what many are doing is simply looking at brain activity and selectively inferring its function, when there&#39;s never a clear one-to-one mapping between brain activity observed with fMRI and the consequent mental operations. Not only does this tell me how little we understand psychedelics, it also tells me how little we understand how to study them.”</p><p>然而，就目前而言，萨尔维诺林A仍然一如既往地神秘，这突显了我们有多少关于迷幻药的知识需要学习。“有很多关于大脑如何产生思想和行为的信息，但其中大部分在迷幻研究中被忽视了，”多斯说。“相反，许多人所做的只是观察大脑活动，并选择性地推断其功能，而用功能磁共振成像观察到的大脑活动和随后的精神操作之间从来没有明确的一对一映射。”这不仅告诉我我们对迷幻有多么不了解，也告诉我我们对如何研究它们知之甚少。“。</p><p>   🏃🏽‍♀️ Want the best tools to get healthy?
